What are the key features of the Morane-Saulnier MS.315's design, including its wing configuration, landing gear, and engine?	An MS.315 is a parasol-winged monoplane with a tailwheel, divided main landing gear, and a Salmson 9Nc radial engine with 135hp (101kW).	The Morane-Saulnier MS.315 was a popular French parasol-wing monoplane trainer aircraft. Here are its key design features:  *   **Wing Configuration:** The most distinctive feature was its **parasol wing**. This meant the wing was mounted above the fuselage on struts. This provided good visibility for the pilot and instructor, a crucial aspect for a trainer. The wing was typically of a wooden construction, fabric-covered.  *   **Landing Gear:** It had a **fixed, conventional landing gear** configuration. This meant it had two main wheels under the fuselage and a tail skid (later sometimes a tailwheel). The fixed landing gear was simple and robust, suitable for the rigors of training.  *   **Engine:** It was typically powered by a **Salmson 9AB radial engine**. This was a 9-cylinder, air-cooled engine that provided reliable power for training purposes. The engine was usually uncowled or had a partial cowling, leaving much of the engine exposed for cooling.

What is the affinity of the dimeric form of M2-PK to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and its activity at physiological PEP concentrations?	However, the dimeric form of M2-PK is characterized by a low affinity to phosphoenolpyruvate and is nearly inactive at physiological PEP concentrations.	The dimeric form of M2-PK has a **low affinity** for phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). Consequently, its activity is **low** at physiological PEP concentrations. This is because the dimeric form is less efficient at binding PEP, the substrate, and therefore less efficient at catalyzing the reaction. The tetrameric form, in contrast, has a high affinity for PEP and is highly active. The balance between the dimeric and tetrameric forms of M2-PK is crucial for its role in cellular metabolism.

What comic strips were notable examples of attempts to revive the full-page Sunday comic strip in the mid-1950s?	In the mid- 1950s, there were some attempts to revive the full page Sunday comic strip, notably Lance and Johnny Reb and Billy Yank.	While the full-page Sunday comic strip was largely in decline by the mid-1950s, a few notable examples attempted to keep the format alive or even revive it. These included:  *   **Prince Valiant:** Hal Foster's *Prince Valiant* was a consistent example of a full-page Sunday strip that maintained its popularity and artistic quality throughout the 1950s and beyond. Its detailed artwork and epic storytelling were well-suited to the larger format.  *   **Flash Gordon:** Although its popularity had waned somewhat from its heyday, *Flash Gordon* continued as a full-page Sunday strip in many newspapers during this period, showcasing science fiction adventures.  *   **Tarzan:** Burne Hogarth's run on *Tarzan* had ended in the late 1940s, but the strip continued in the full-page format with other artists, maintaining its adventure-oriented storytelling.  It's important to note that while these strips were notable, the trend was still toward smaller formats. The cost of printing and the desire to include more comics in a newspaper led to the gradual decline of the full-page Sunday strip.

In the derivation of Kirchhoff's diffraction formula, is it assumed that the field and its derivative are zero on the opaque parts of the screen?	That is not the case, and this is one of the approximations used to derive the equation.	Yes, in the standard derivation of Kirchhoff's diffraction formula, it is assumed that the field (both the scalar field *U* and its normal derivative ∂*U*/∂*n*) and its derivative are zero on the opaque parts of the screen. This is a crucial part of the Kirchhoff boundary conditions.  However, it's important to note that this is an **approximation**. This assumption is known to be problematic and is one of the main criticisms of Kirchhoff's diffraction theory. In reality, the field is not perfectly zero on the opaque parts of the screen due to effects like scattering and edge diffraction.  Therefore, while the assumption is made for the mathematical derivation, it's understood to be an idealization that introduces some error into the results. More sophisticated diffraction theories, like the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction theory, attempt to address these limitations.
