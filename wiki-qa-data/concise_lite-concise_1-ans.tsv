What is the purpose of Sensory Stimulation Therapy (SS)?	Sensory Stimulation Therapy (SS) is experimental; aiming to use neural plasticity mechanisms to aid in the recovery of somatosensory system function after stroke or cognitive ageing.	The purpose of Sensory Stimulation Therapy (SS) is to **improve a person's awareness, responsiveness, and overall well-being by providing controlled and meaningful sensory experiences.**  Here's a more detailed breakdown:  *   **Increase Awareness:** SS aims to awaken and stimulate the senses (sight, sound, touch, smell, taste, and movement) to help individuals become more aware of themselves and their environment. *   **Enhance Responsiveness:** By providing sensory input, SS can encourage individuals to react and respond to stimuli, even if they have limited communication or physical abilities. *   **Promote Relaxation and Comfort:** Certain sensory experiences, such as gentle touch or calming music, can help reduce anxiety, agitation, and pain, promoting relaxation and a sense of comfort. *   **Improve Cognitive Function:** SS can help improve attention, memory, and other cognitive functions by stimulating the brain and encouraging neural connections. *   **Facilitate Communication:** By increasing awareness and responsiveness, SS can create opportunities for communication, even if it's non-verbal. *   **Enhance Quality of Life:** Ultimately, SS aims to improve the overall quality of life for individuals with sensory impairments, cognitive disabilities, or neurological conditions by providing them with meaningful and enjoyable experiences.  SS is often used with individuals who have:  *   Dementia *   Brain injuries *   Developmental disabilities *   Coma or vegetative state *   Sensory processing disorders	{'rouge1': Score(precision=0.5769230769230769, recall=0.07317073170731707, fmeasure=0.12987012987012989), 'rougeL': Score(precision=0.46153846153846156, recall=0.05853658536585366, fmeasure=0.10389610389610389)}	Answer the following question.	gemini-2.0-flash	gemini-2.0-flash
