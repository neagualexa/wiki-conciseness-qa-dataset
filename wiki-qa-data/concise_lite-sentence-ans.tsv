What is the affinity of the dimeric form of M2-PK to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and its activity at physiological PEP concentrations?	In contrast, the dimeric form of M2-PK is characterized by a low affinity to phosphoenolpyruvate and is nearly inactive at physiological PEP concentrations.	The dimeric form of M2-PK has a **low affinity** for phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). Consequently, its activity is **low** at physiological PEP concentrations. This is because the dimeric form is less efficient at binding PEP, the substrate, and therefore less efficient at catalyzing the reaction. The tetrameric form, in contrast, has a high affinity for PEP and is highly active. The balance between the dimeric and tetrameric forms of M2-PK is crucial for its role in cellular metabolism.

Which comic strips were notable attempts to revive the full-page Sunday comic strip in the mid-1950s?	In the mid- 1950s, there were a few attempts to revive the full page Sunday comic strip, notably Lance and Johnny Reb and Billy Yank.	"Two notable comic strips that attempted to revive the full-page Sunday comic strip format in the mid-1950s were:  *   **Prince Valiant:** While *Prince Valiant* had been running since 1937, it remained a prominent example of the full-page format and continued to be a standard-bearer for this style during the 1950s.  *   **Hal Foster's adaptation of ""The Song of Hiawatha"":** In 1955, Hal Foster, the creator of *Prince Valiant*, adapted Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem ""The Song of Hiawatha"" into a full-page comic strip for a limited run. This was a specific, high-profile attempt to showcase the potential of the full-page format."

Is it always the case that the field and its derivative are zero on the back side of the opaque screen in the derivation of Kirchhoff's diffraction formula?	This is not the case, and this is one of the approximations used in deriving the equation.	"No, it is **not always the case** that the field and its derivative are zero on the back side of the opaque screen in the derivation of Kirchhoff's diffraction formula. This is a crucial point and a significant approximation in the Kirchhoff theory.  Here's why:  * **Kirchhoff Boundary Conditions are Approximations:** The Kirchhoff diffraction formula relies on specific boundary conditions applied at the aperture and the opaque screen.  These boundary conditions are:     * **In the aperture:** The field *U* and its normal derivative ∂*U*/∂*n* are equal to the undisturbed field and its derivative as if the screen were not present.     * **On the opaque screen:**  *U* = 0 and ∂*U*/∂*n* = 0.  * **Physical Reality:**  In reality, the field doesn't abruptly drop to zero at the edge of the aperture or on the back side of the screen.  There will always be some penetration of the field into the ""shadow"" region due to diffraction and scattering.  The field and its derivative will be small, but generally non-zero.  * **The Inconsistency:** The assumption of *U* = 0 and ∂*U*/∂*n* = 0 on the back side of the screen is inconsistent with the Helmholtz-Kirchhoff integral theorem itself.  The theorem requires knowledge of the field and its derivative *everywhere* on the closed surface.  By setting them to zero on the back side, we are essentially making an assumption about the solution that might not be valid.  * **Why it Works (Sometimes):** Despite the inconsistency, the Kirchhoff approximation often provides reasonably accurate results, especially when:     * The wavelength of light is much smaller than the dimensions of the aperture.     * The observation point is not too close to the aperture.     * We are interested in the far-field diffraction pattern.  * **More Accurate Theories:** More sophisticated diffraction theories, such as the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction theory, use different boundary conditions that are more physically realistic and avoid the inconsistency of the Kirchhoff approach.  These theories often provide more accurate results, especially when the Kirchhoff approximation breaks down.  **In summary:** The assumption of zero field and derivative on the back side of the screen is a simplifying approximation in the Kirchhoff diffraction formula. It's not always true, and it introduces an inconsistency into the theory. However, it often provides a useful and reasonably accurate approximation under certain conditions."

What distinctions did the Monterrey Steel hold regarding their participation in American arena/indoor football leagues?	The Steel were the first team from Mexico to play in an American arena/indoor football league, as well as the first team from outside the United States to play in one since the Toronto Phantoms of the Arena Football League (2001-2002).	The Monterrey Steel, during their brief existence, held the distinction of being:  *   **One of the few Mexican teams to participate in a major American arena/indoor football league.** They were part of the National Arena League (NAL). This made them a unique entity, bridging the gap between American and Mexican football markets. *   **A team that faced significant logistical and financial challenges due to their location.** Being based in Monterrey, Mexico, presented hurdles related to travel, visas, and potentially differing business practices compared to their American counterparts. *   **A team with a relatively short lifespan.** They only played for one season (2017) before ceasing operations. This makes them a notable, but ultimately short-lived, experiment in cross-border arena football.

What is the purpose of Sensory Stimulation Therapy (SS)?	Sensory Stimulation Therapy (SS) is an experimental therapy that aims to utilize neural plasticity mechanisms to aid in the recovery of somatosensory system function after stroke or cognitive ageing.	The purpose of Sensory Stimulation Therapy (SS) is to **improve a person's awareness, responsiveness, and overall well-being by providing controlled and meaningful sensory experiences.**  Here's a more detailed breakdown:  *   **Increase Awareness:** SS aims to awaken and stimulate the senses (sight, sound, touch, taste, smell, and movement) to help individuals become more aware of themselves and their environment. *   **Enhance Responsiveness:** By providing sensory input, SS can encourage individuals to react and respond to stimuli, even if they have limited communication or physical abilities. *   **Promote Relaxation and Comfort:** Certain sensory experiences, such as gentle touch or calming music, can help reduce anxiety, agitation, and pain, promoting relaxation and a sense of comfort. *   **Improve Cognitive Function:** SS can help improve attention, memory, and other cognitive functions by stimulating the brain and encouraging neural connections. *   **Enhance Communication:** By increasing awareness and responsiveness, SS can facilitate communication, even if it's non-verbal. *   **Improve Mood and Emotional Well-being:** Sensory experiences can evoke positive emotions and memories, improving mood and overall emotional well-being. *   **Maintain or Improve Physical Function:** Sensory stimulation can sometimes help maintain or improve physical function by encouraging movement and coordination.  SS is often used with individuals who have:  *   Dementia *   Brain injuries *   Developmental disabilities *   Coma or vegetative state *   Other conditions that affect sensory processing or awareness.
