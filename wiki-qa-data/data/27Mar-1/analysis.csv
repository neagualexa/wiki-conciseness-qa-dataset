He would have acknowledged her secular authority and social standing as a powerful noblewoman. He wouldn't have directly challenged her right to the title or her position.  *   **Expectation of Moral Conduct:** Grosseteste was a strong advocate for moral reform and believed that all members of society, regardless of their rank, were accountable to God. He would have expected Margaret de Quincy to live a virtuous life and to use her power to promote justice and righteousness within her lands. This expectation would have extended to her role in protecting the vulnerable and ensuring fair treatment for all.  *   **Potential for Conflict:** While he would have respected her position, Grosseteste was not afraid to confront powerful individuals, including nobles and even the King, if he believed they were acting unjustly or immorally. If Margaret de Quincy had engaged in behavior that Grosseteste considered sinful or detrimental to the well-being of her people, he would likely have intervened, either through private counsel or, if necessary, through public rebuke.  *   **Evidence is Limited:** It's important to note that specific details about Grosseteste's direct interactions with Margaret de Quincy are scarce. Historians would need to examine surviving letters, records of ecclesiastical proceedings, or other contemporary sources to gain a more precise understanding of their relationship. However, based on Grosseteste's known principles and his interactions with other nobles, we can infer the general nature of his view.  In summary, Grosseteste likely viewed Margaret de Quincy as a powerful figure whose authority he respected, but also as someone who had a moral obligation to use her position for the good of her people and in accordance with Christian principles."", ""Concerns arose regarding China's intentions after obtaining the T-10K (the prototype for the Su-33) from Ukraine because it provided them with a crucial technological stepping stone for developing their own carrier-based fighter aircraft. Here's a breakdown of the reasons:  *   **Reverse Engineering and Indigenous Development:** The T-10K allowed China to study the design, engineering, and technology of a high-performance carrier-based fighter. This significantly accelerated their own indigenous development program for such aircraft. Without it, they would have had to start from scratch, which would have taken much longer and been more challenging.  *   **Closing the Technological Gap:** At the time, China lacked experience in designing and building carrier-based aircraft. The Su-33 was a proven and capable platform. Acquiring the T-10K allowed them to close the technological gap with countries like Russia and the United States, which already possessed advanced carrier aviation capabilities.  *   **Military Modernization and Power Projection:** Developing a carrier-based fighter was a key component of China's broader military modernization efforts. It would significantly enhance their power projection capabilities, allowing them to operate aircraft carriers and project air power far beyond their shores. This raised concerns among neighboring countries and the United States about China's growing military influence in the region.  *   **Potential for Regional Instability:** The acquisition and subsequent development of carrier-based aircraft could potentially alter the balance of power in the region, leading to increased tensions and a greater risk of conflict.  *   **Intellectual Property Concerns:** There were also concerns about China potentially copying or reverse-engineering the Su-33's technology without proper authorization or licensing agreements.  In essence, the T-10K provided China with a shortcut to developing a critical military capability, raising concerns about their long-term strategic goals and the potential impact on regional and global security."", 'The Call-Up recorded their self-titled EP in **December 2006** at **The Farm** in Vancouver, BC. **Shawn Penner** helped them with the recording.', 'Maria Felicia Gunawan, a non-academic achiever from Sekolah Menengah Atas Kristen Penabur Gading Serpong, won a **gold medal at the International Exhibition for Young Inventors (IEYI) in 2015**.', 'Netscape Internet Service no longer exists.

The format was still popular, but facing challenges from rising production costs and shrinking newspaper sizes. Here are some notable aspects of that period:  *   **Maintaining Popularity:** The existing popular strips like *Peanuts*, *Blondie*, *Li'l Abner*, *Dick Tracy*, *Prince Valiant*, and *Flash Gordon* continued to be produced in the full-page format, demonstrating its ongoing appeal. Publishers and syndicates were keen to keep these successful strips going in the format that readers expected.  *   **Experimentation with Layout and Content:** While the basic format remained, some artists and writers experimented with the layout of panels and the types of stories told within the full-page format. This included more complex narratives, visual gags, and innovative uses of color.  *   **Color Printing Advancements:** Improvements in color printing technology allowed for more vibrant and detailed Sunday comics, enhancing their visual appeal and helping to retain readership.  *   **Competition from Television:** The rise of television posed a significant challenge to all forms of print media, including comic strips. Newspapers and syndicates had to work harder to make the Sunday comics a compelling draw for readers. This led to a focus on quality storytelling and artwork to compete with the new medium.  In summary, the mid-1950s weren't about reviving a dead format, but about adapting and innovating within the existing full-page Sunday comic strip format to maintain its popularity in the face of rising costs and competition from television."", ""One of the approximations used in deriving Kirchhoff's diffraction formula is that **the field and its normal derivative on the diffracting aperture are the same as they would be in the absence of the screen.**"", 'Researchers are likely trying to ascertain the relationship between religion and ancient politics in Wisconsin and the Cahokia area by investigating how religious beliefs, practices, and institutions may have influenced:  *   **Political structures and leadership:** Did religious leaders also hold political power?

Here are its key design and engine features:  **Design Features:**  *   **Parasol Wing:** This was a defining feature. The wing was mounted above the fuselage on struts, providing excellent visibility for both the instructor and student. This also simplified the wing structure and allowed for a relatively clean fuselage. *   **All-Wood Construction:** The aircraft was primarily built from wood, covered in fabric. This was a common construction method at the time, offering a good balance of strength and weight. *   **Tandem Open Cockpits:** The MS.315 featured two open cockpits arranged in tandem, one for the instructor and one for the student. This allowed for direct communication and observation during training. *   **Fixed Landing Gear:** It had a simple, fixed landing gear configuration with a tailskid. This made it robust and easy to maintain, suitable for training operations. *   **Simple Aerodynamics:** The design prioritized stability and ease of handling, making it an ideal trainer. It wasn't designed for high performance or complex maneuvers. *   **Robust and Reliable:** The MS.315 was known for its ruggedness and reliability, essential qualities for a training aircraft that would be subjected to frequent use and sometimes less-than-perfect landings.  **Engine Features:**  *   **Salmson 9AB Radial Engine:** The MS.315 was typically powered by a Salmson 9AB nine-cylinder radial engine. *   **Air-Cooled:** The Salmson 9AB was air-cooled, which simplified the engine design and reduced the risk of leaks compared to liquid-cooled engines. *   **Power Output:** The engine typically produced around 80-85 horsepower. This was sufficient for the aircraft's intended role as a primary trainer. *   **Reliability:** The Salmson 9AB was a relatively reliable engine for its time, contributing to the overall dependability of the MS.315. *   **Simple Design:** The radial engine design was relatively simple and easy to maintain, which was important for training operations where maintenance time needed to be minimized.  In summary, the Morane-Saulnier MS.315 was a successful trainer due to its simple, robust design, excellent visibility, and reliable engine. Its parasol wing, open cockpits, and fixed landing gear were all key features that contributed to its effectiveness as a primary training aircraft."", 'After his initial work, Teun Voeten covered the following conflicts as a full-time war correspondent:  *   **Sierra Leone** *   **Liberia** *   **Sudan (Darfur)** *   **Colombia** *   **Afghanistan** *   **Iraq** *   **Mexico (drug war)**  He worked for various publications, including:  *   **NRC Handelsblad (Netherlands)** *   **Vrij Nederland (Netherlands)** *   **Granta (UK)** *   **Vanity Fair (US)** *   **The Village Voice (US)** *   **Mother Jones (US)** *   **Newsweek (US)** *   **National Geographic (US)**', 'Robert Grosseteste held Margaret de Quincy, Countess of Lincoln, in high regard and saw her as a powerful and influential figure capable of promoting reform and good governance within her sphere of influence. He believed she had a responsibility to use her position and wealth to support the Church, care for the poor, and ensure justice was served.  Specifically, Grosseteste:  *   **Recognized her power and influence:** He understood that as a Countess, Margaret held significant sway over her lands and people. He believed she could use this power for good. *   **Saw her as a potential agent of reform:** Grosseteste was a strong advocate for Church reform and believed that laypeople, especially those in positions of authority, could play a crucial role in this process. He likely saw Margaret as someone who could influence local clergy and promote better practices. *   **Expected her to uphold moral standards:** Grosseteste was known for his strict moral code and expected those in positions of power to live exemplary lives. He likely believed Margaret should set a good example for her subjects. *   **Encouraged her to support the Church and the poor:** Grosseteste often preached about the importance of charity and supporting the Church. He likely encouraged Margaret to use her wealth to fund religious institutions and provide for the needy.  In essence, Grosseteste viewed Margaret de Quincy as a powerful and influential woman who had a moral obligation to use her position to promote justice, charity, and good governance within her earldom. He saw her as a potential ally in his efforts to reform the Church and improve society.', ""The acquisition of the Su-33 prototype (T-10K) from Ukraine by China raised several concerns, primarily related to:  *   **Reverse Engineering and Indigenous Development:** The biggest concern was that China would use the T-10K to reverse engineer the Su-33's technology and develop its own indigenous carrier-based fighter. This proved to be the case, as the T-10K significantly aided in the development of the J-15 Flying Shark.  *   **Circumventing Technology Transfer Restrictions:** By acquiring a prototype instead of a complete, operational aircraft, China could potentially circumvent international restrictions on the transfer of advanced military technology.  *   **Impact on Regional Power Balance:** The development of a carrier-based fighter capability based on the Su-33 design would significantly enhance China's naval power projection capabilities, potentially altering the regional balance of power in the Asia-Pacific region.  *   **Loss of Ukrainian Expertise:** There were also concerns about the potential loss of Ukrainian expertise in aircraft design and manufacturing, as Chinese engineers would likely seek to learn from and potentially recruit Ukrainian specialists involved in the Su-33 program.  In essence, the acquisition of the T-10K was seen as a shortcut for China to rapidly develop a carrier-based fighter capability, raising concerns about technology theft, regional security, and the potential for China to project power further afield."", 'The Call-Up recorded their self-titled EP in **2006** at **The Farm** in Vancouver, BC. **Shawn Penner** helped them with the recording.', ""While I don't have access to a real-time database of specific student achievements at Sekolah Menengah Atas Kristen Penabur Gading Serpong, I can provide a hypothetical example based on the information you've given:  **Hypothetical Example:**  Let's say a student named **Maria Susanto** at Sekolah Menengah Atas Kristen Penabur Gading Serpong is a dedicated member of the school's Paskibra (flag-raising team).

This means it requires a higher concentration of PEP to achieve the same level of binding and activity.  *   **Lower Activity at Physiological PEP Concentrations:** Because of its lower affinity, the dimeric form is much less active at physiological PEP concentrations. In other words, under normal cellular conditions where PEP levels are within a certain range, the dimeric M2-PK will not be as efficient at catalyzing the conversion of PEP to pyruvate as the tetrameric form would be. This leads to a bottleneck in glycolysis.  In summary, the dimeric form of M2-PK is characterized by a **lower affinity for PEP** and **reduced activity at physiological PEP concentrations** compared to the tetrameric form. This shift towards the dimeric form in cancer cells contributes to the Warburg effect, where glycolysis is favored even in the presence of oxygen.', 'Gregory Jim Rutherford Polanco is a Dominican professional baseball outfielder.

This led to a reduction in size and complexity for many strips. Therefore, ""revival"" efforts were more about maintaining or enhancing the format against these pressures rather than a complete resurrection. Here are some notable aspects of that period:  *   **Efforts to Maintain Quality and Detail:** Some artists and writers actively resisted the trend towards smaller, simpler strips. They continued to produce visually rich and narratively complex full-page comics, even if it meant working harder or negotiating with syndicates. Examples include artists who maintained a high level of detail in their artwork, even as the size of the panels decreased.  *   **Experimentation with Format:** Some creators experimented with different layouts and panel arrangements within the full-page format to maximize visual impact and storytelling potential. This included using larger splash panels, innovative panel borders, and creative use of color.  *   **Popularity of Established Strips:** The continued popularity of established, well-loved strips helped to keep the full-page format alive. Strips like *Prince Valiant* by Hal Foster, *Flash Gordon* by Dan Barry, *Little Orphan Annie* by Harold Gray, and *Dick Tracy* by Chester Gould were still widely read and valued for their detailed artwork and engaging stories. Their success demonstrated that there was still an audience for high-quality, full-page comics.  *   **Color Printing Advancements:** Improvements in color printing technology allowed for more vibrant and detailed color reproduction in Sunday comics. This helped to enhance the visual appeal of full-page strips and make them more attractive to readers.  *   **Syndicate Support (to a degree):** While syndicates were often driven by cost-cutting measures, they also recognized the value of popular full-page strips in attracting readers to newspapers. Some syndicates continued to support artists who were committed to producing high-quality, full-page comics, even if it meant higher production costs.  It\'s important to note that there wasn\'t a single, organized ""revival"" movement. Instead, it was a combination of individual efforts by artists, writers, and syndicates to maintain the quality and appeal of full-page Sunday comics in the face of economic and technological challenges. The full-page format continued, albeit often in a reduced size, and these efforts helped ensure its survival.', ""Yes, it is accurate to assume that the field and its normal derivative are zero on the opaque parts of the screen when deriving Kirchhoff's diffraction formula. This is a crucial part of the Kirchhoff boundary conditions, which are used to approximate the field on the surface of the integration.  Here's why:  * **Kirchhoff Boundary Conditions:** The Kirchhoff diffraction formula relies on applying the Helmholtz-Kirchhoff integral theorem. This theorem requires knowing the values of the field (U) and its normal derivative (∂U/∂n) on a closed surface.  The standard approach is to choose a surface that includes the diffracting aperture and a large hemisphere at infinity.  The Kirchhoff boundary conditions are approximations for the values of U and ∂U/∂n on this surface.  * **Opaque Screen Assumption:** The key assumption for the opaque parts of the screen is that they completely block the light.  This means:     * **U = 0:** The field (U), representing the amplitude of the wave, is zero behind the opaque screen.  No light penetrates.     * **∂U/∂n = 0:** The normal derivative of the field is also zero. This implies that the field is not changing in the direction normal to the screen, which is consistent with the absence of light behind the screen.  * **Approximation:** It's important to remember that these are *approximations*. In reality, there might be some small amount of light that penetrates or diffracts around the edges of the opaque screen. However, for many practical situations, these effects are negligible, and the Kirchhoff boundary conditions provide a good approximation.  * **Justification:** The justification for using these approximations lies in the fact that the Kirchhoff diffraction formula provides results that are in good agreement with experimental observations, especially when the dimensions of the aperture are much larger than the wavelength of light.  In summary, setting the field and its normal derivative to zero on the opaque parts of the screen is a fundamental assumption in the derivation of the Kirchhoff diffraction formula. It's an approximation, but a useful one that allows us to calculate the diffracted field with reasonable accuracy in many situations."", 'Researchers at sites in Wisconsin and the Cahokia area are seeking to ascertain the relationship between the people of Cahokia and the Late Woodland peoples of the Upper Midwest, including Wisconsin.

This gave it better stability and handling compared to biplane trainers of the time. *   **Construction:** Mixed construction. The fuselage was typically welded steel tube covered in fabric, while the wings were often wooden with fabric covering. *   **Open Cockpits:** Tandem open cockpits for instructor and student. This allowed for direct communication and observation. *   **Fixed Landing Gear:** Fixed, conventional landing gear (tailwheel configuration). This was simple and robust for training purposes. *   **Simplicity:** Designed for ease of maintenance and repair, crucial for training operations. *   **Dual Controls:** Equipped with dual controls for both the instructor and student. *   **Robustness:** Built to withstand the rigors of student pilot training. *   **Wide Use:** Widely used by the French Air Force and civilian flying clubs.  **Engine Specifications (Typical):**  *   **Engine Type:** Salmson 9AB radial engine. *   **Configuration:** 9-cylinder, air-cooled radial. *   **Power Output:** Approximately 80 horsepower (60 kW). This was sufficient for basic training maneuvers. *   **Fuel:** Gasoline.  **Performance (Approximate):**  *   **Maximum Speed:** Around 160 km/h (100 mph). *   **Range:** Approximately 400 km (250 miles). *   **Service Ceiling:** Around 4,000 m (13,000 ft).  **In summary, the Morane-Saulnier MS.315 was a reliable and straightforward trainer aircraft characterized by its low-wing monoplane design, open cockpits, robust construction, and a relatively low-powered Salmson radial engine.

Here's a breakdown of what we can infer:  *   **Respect for her Status:** Grosseteste was a firm believer in the divinely ordained social order. He would have acknowledged and respected Margaret's position as Countess of Lincoln, a powerful and wealthy noblewoman. He understood the importance of the aristocracy in maintaining social stability.  *   **Concern for her Spiritual Welfare:** Grosseteste was a reformer and a pastor deeply concerned with the moral and spiritual health of his flock, regardless of their social status. He would have seen it as his duty to guide and correct even the Countess of Lincoln if he believed she was straying from the path of righteousness. This concern would have extended to how she used her wealth and power. He likely would have encouraged her to use her resources for charitable works, supporting the church, and ensuring justice within her lands.  *   **Potential for Conflict:** Grosseteste was known for his uncompromising stance against corruption and abuse of power, even within the Church itself. If Margaret de Quincy was perceived to be neglecting her duties, exploiting her tenants, or engaging in activities that Grosseteste considered sinful, he would not have hesitated to confront her. He was known for his strong letters of admonishment to people of all ranks.  *   **Evidence is Limited:** Direct evidence of Grosseteste's specific views on Margaret de Quincy is scarce. We don't have a surviving letter directly addressed to her, for example. Therefore, we must infer his views based on his general principles and his known interactions with other members of the nobility.  In conclusion, Grosseteste likely viewed Margaret de Quincy as a person of significant social standing whose spiritual well-being was his responsibility. He would have expected her to use her position and wealth responsibly and in accordance with Christian principles, and he would have been prepared to challenge her if he believed she was failing in this regard."", ""The acquisition of the Su-33 prototype (T-10K) from Ukraine prompted concerns regarding China's intentions because it provided them with a crucial technological stepping stone for developing their own carrier-based fighter aircraft. Specifically:  *   **Reverse Engineering and Indigenous Development:** The primary concern was that China would reverse engineer the Su-33 prototype to develop its own indigenous carrier-based fighter. This would significantly enhance their naval aviation capabilities and reduce their reliance on foreign suppliers.  *   **Advancement of Naval Power Projection:** A carrier-based fighter is a critical component of a modern aircraft carrier and a key element in projecting naval power. Acquiring the Su-33 prototype signaled China's ambition to develop a powerful blue-water navy capable of operating far from its shores.  *   **Potential for Regional Power Imbalance:** The development of a carrier-based fighter capability raised concerns about a potential shift in the regional balance of power in the Asia-Pacific region. It could allow China to exert greater influence over maritime disputes and project its military power more effectively.  *   **Technology Transfer Concerns:** There were also concerns that China might share or sell the technology derived from the Su-33 prototype to other countries, potentially contributing to the proliferation of advanced military technology.  In essence, the Su-33 prototype was seen as a shortcut for China to acquire advanced naval aviation technology, accelerating their military modernization and potentially altering the strategic landscape."", 'The Call-Up recorded their self-titled EP ""Undecided"" in **2005** at **The Blasting Room** in **Fort Collins, Colorado**.

Newspaper space was becoming more valuable, and many papers were shrinking the size of their comics sections. This led to a reduction in the size of the Sunday strips, often to half-page or even smaller formats.  Therefore, the ""revival"" wasn\'t about bringing back something that had completely disappeared, but rather about **maintaining and, in some cases, expanding the presence and artistry of the full-page format in the face of these pressures.**  Here\'s what attempts were made and some notable examples:  *   **Artist and Syndicate Resistance:** Some artists and their syndicates actively resisted the trend towards smaller formats. They argued that the full-page format allowed for more detailed artwork, more complex storytelling, and a greater sense of visual spectacle. They lobbied newspapers to maintain the larger size.  *   **Emphasis on Visual Spectacle and Detail:** Artists who continued to work in the full-page format often doubled down on the visual aspects of their strips. They used the larger canvas to create elaborate backgrounds, dynamic action sequences, and intricate character designs. This was a way to justify the larger space and provide readers with a more immersive experience.  *   **Experimentation with Layout and Design:** Some artists experimented with innovative layouts and panel arrangements to make the most of the full-page format. They might use a single large panel to depict a key moment, or create a series of smaller panels that flowed seamlessly across the page.  **Notable Examples of Comic Strips that Maintained or Emphasized the Full-Page Format in the Mid-1950s:**  *   **Prince Valiant (Hal Foster):** Foster\'s *Prince Valiant* was a prime example of a strip that thrived on the full-page format. Its stunning artwork, detailed historical settings, and epic storylines demanded a large canvas. It was a major selling point for many newspapers.  *   **Flash Gordon (Dan Barry):** While *Flash Gordon* had various artists over the years, the mid-1950s saw Dan Barry taking over. He continued the tradition of visually stunning science fiction adventures that benefited greatly from the full-page format.  *   **Rip Kirby (Alex Raymond, later John Prentice):** Raymond\'s stylish and sophisticated detective strip, and later Prentice\'s continuation of it, used the full-page format to showcase its elegant artwork and intricate plots.  *   **The Phantom (Lee Falk and Wilson McCoy):** *The Phantom* continued its tradition of adventure stories set in exotic locales, and the full-page format allowed for detailed depictions of the jungle and its inhabitants.  *   **Tarzan (Various Artists):** The *Tarzan* comic strip, with its jungle settings and action-packed adventures, also benefited from the larger format.  *   **Little Orphan Annie (Harold Gray):** While *Little Orphan Annie* was known for its storytelling, the full-page format allowed for more detailed backgrounds and character interactions.  It\'s important to note that even these strips might have faced pressure to reduce their size in some markets. However, they represent a commitment to the artistic and storytelling possibilities of the full-page Sunday comic strip during a period of change in the newspaper industry.', ""No, it is **not** accurate to assume that no approximations are made when deriving Kirchhoff's diffraction formula. In fact, the derivation relies on several key approximations, which limit its accuracy and applicability.  Here are the main approximations involved:  *   **Kirchhoff Boundary Conditions:** This is the most significant approximation. It assumes that the field (both the wave function and its normal derivative) on the diffracting screen is exactly the same as it would be if the screen were infinitely large and unobstructed. In other words, it assumes the field is undisturbed on the open parts of the aperture and zero on the opaque parts. This is clearly not true, especially near the edges of the aperture, where the field is significantly affected by the presence of the screen.  *   **Obliquity Factor:** The obliquity factor (often denoted as (1 + cos θ)/2) arises from the application of Green's theorem. While it's a necessary part of the mathematical derivation, it's often simplified or ignored in certain situations, which can introduce further approximations.  *   **Scalar Theory:** Kirchhoff's diffraction formula is a scalar theory, meaning it treats light as a scalar wave and ignores its vector nature (polarization). This is a good approximation when the aperture dimensions are much larger than the wavelength of light, but it becomes less accurate when the aperture size approaches the wavelength.  *   **Far-Field Approximation (Fraunhofer Diffraction):** While not strictly part of the *derivation* of the Kirchhoff integral, the Kirchhoff integral is often simplified using the Fraunhofer approximation when calculating the diffraction pattern at a large distance from the aperture. This approximation assumes that the distance to the observation point is much larger than the size of the aperture, which simplifies the integral.  In summary, Kirchhoff's diffraction formula is a powerful tool for understanding diffraction, but it's important to remember that it's based on several approximations. These approximations can limit its accuracy, especially when dealing with small apertures, short wavelengths, or regions close to the diffracting screen. More sophisticated diffraction theories, such as those based on vector diffraction or rigorous numerical methods, are needed for higher accuracy in these cases."", 'Researchers are seeking to ascertain the relationship of religion and ancient politics in a variety of places, including:  *   **Archaeological sites:** Excavations of temples, palaces, and other ancient structures can provide evidence of religious practices and their connection to political power. *   **Ancient texts:** Religious and political texts from ancient civilizations, such as the Bible, the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Code of Hammurabi, and the writings of ancient philosophers, offer insights into the beliefs and practices of the time and their relationship to political structures. *   **Museums and collections:** Artifacts and documents housed in museums and collections around the world can provide valuable information about ancient religions and politics. *   **Universities and research institutions:** Scholars at universities and research institutions conduct research on ancient religions and politics, using a variety of methods and sources. *   **Libraries and archives:** Libraries and archives hold a wealth of primary and secondary sources related to ancient religions and politics.
