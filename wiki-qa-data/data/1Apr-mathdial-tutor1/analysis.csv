"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use (with examples): ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use (with examples): ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use (with examples): ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Format your answer as follows: (Teaching Method) (Response) Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.280274337093472, 0.0595901505578131, 0.0634508564975691, 0.0, 0.1072481046120325, 0.2331032305449905, 0.1887971609447683, 0.4482468976384072, 0.218167631398606, 0.2372445311148961, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1737546155282429, 0.1121535111154828, 0.1455629308592705, 0.2691694521503486, 0.0387265856899321, 0.1543118895803178, 0.1429861229229596, 0.2223921435844164, 0.1244109327523227, 0.0, 0.1376201412853196, 0.0359484198870081, 0.0885679996609688, 0.1497610494494438]","[2.4166666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 1.7142857142857142, 1.8571428571428572, 2.142857142857143, 2.4, 1.5833333333333333, 0.8064516129032258, 0.3714285714285714, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 3.0, 1.8888888888888888, 1.7, 2.4285714285714284, 1.1071428571428572, 0.9130434782608696, 0.56, 1.4285714285714286, 0.7777777777777778, 0.8181818181818182, 1.2592592592592593, 1.8571428571428572, 0.5333333333333333, 2.090909090909091, 1.875, 0.9090909090909092]","[""{'precision': 0.13864237070083618, 'recall': 0.22377946972846985, 'f1': 0.18218955397605896}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.29420068860054016, 'recall': 0.45664507150650024, 'f1': 0.37520068883895874}"", ""{'precision': 0.13351726531982422, 'recall': 0.29529616236686707, 'f1': 0.21441839635372162}"", ""{'precision': 0.29231661558151245, 'recall': 0.2771975100040436, 'f1': 0.28590792417526245}"", ""{'precision': -0.16725677251815796, 'recall': -0.02978040836751461, 'f1': -0.09770578891038895}"", ""{'precision': 0.218782439827919, 'recall': 0.24108827114105225, 'f1': 0.2311628758907318}"", ""{'precision': 0.24765720963478088, 'recall': 0.2681216597557068, 'f1': 0.25907573103904724}"", ""{'precision': 0.17579273879528046, 'recall': 0.0702231302857399, 'f1': 0.12388003617525101}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.08622314035892487, 'recall': 0.32667577266693115, 'f1': 0.2049374133348465}"", ""{'precision': 0.25753599405288696, 'recall': 0.3161171078681946, 'f1': 0.2878223955631256}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.13379955291748047, 'recall': 0.09721406549215317, 'f1': 0.11687683314085007}"", ""{'precision': 0.015880854800343513, 'recall': 0.0830654427409172, 'f1': 0.05079316720366478}"", ""{'precision': 0.23008720576763153, 'recall': 0.4026769995689392, 'f1': 0.31608065962791443}"", ""{'precision': 0.296329528093338, 'recall': 0.46848103404045105, 'f1': 0.38202130794525146}"", ""{'precision': 0.12538881599903107, 'recall': 0.12354177236557007, 'f1': 0.12588776648044586}"", ""{'precision': 0.3607337772846222, 'recall': 0.31556951999664307, 'f1': 0.33912941813468933}"", ""{'precision': -0.07983797043561935, 'recall': 0.057360295206308365, 'f1': -0.010546828620135784}"", ""{'precision': 0.31597214937210083, 'recall': 0.2876557409763336, 'f1': 0.3029094934463501}"", ""{'precision': 0.09233592450618744, 'recall': 0.2008637934923172, 'f1': 0.14741015434265137}"", ""{'precision': 0.22945044934749603, 'recall': 0.2754858434200287, 'f1': 0.2535819411277771}"", ""{'precision': 0.1828542798757553, 'recall': 0.2094971388578415, 'f1': 0.19744791090488434}"", ""{'precision': 0.10266786813735962, 'recall': 0.19699440896511078, 'f1': 0.1507779061794281}"", ""{'precision': 0.10981395095586777, 'recall': 0.047144029289484024, 'f1': 0.07977928966283798}"", ""{'precision': 0.09698135405778885, 'recall': 0.290243923664093, 'f1': 0.1931089609861374}"", ""{'precision': 0.07298797369003296, 'recall': 0.2475324124097824, 'f1': 0.16013599932193756}"", ""{'precision': 0.09527769684791565, 'recall': 0.10083868354558945, 'f1': 0.09952209889888763}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.0602024057870188, 0.0369230996710913, 0.0334222354874107, 0.0, 0.0172822121316674, 0.2822177794147447, 0.1264396151914723, 0.4482468976384072, 0.2166361496557471, 0.2112315144141515, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1458772459155634, 0.0484547153022719, 0.0976198112765639, 0.1287198804729226, 0.0252047787261781, 0.0963881797449929, 0.0319340280246817, 0.2765885904901324, 0.0176132574100486, 0.0, 0.1542999093435335, 0.2538067443387491, 0.0, 0.1461071665346364]","[2.1666666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 2.7142857142857144, 1.7142857142857142, 2.142857142857143, 1.4, 1.3333333333333333, 0.3870967741935484, 0.6285714285714286, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 4.8, 1.5555555555555556, 2.7, 2.142857142857143, 0.6071428571428571, 1.608695652173913, 1.2, 1.7857142857142858, 1.1111111111111112, 0.4545454545454545, 1.4074074074074074, 3.2857142857142856, 0.5333333333333333, 1.3636363636363635, 5.125, 0.8181818181818182]","[""{'precision': 0.11144650727510452, 'recall': 0.16678740084171295, 'f1': 0.1403663456439972}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.16733106970787048, 'recall': 0.34498879313468933, 'f1': 0.2558545470237732}"", ""{'precision': 0.14777971804141998, 'recall': 0.12287995219230652, 'f1': 0.13670334219932556}"", ""{'precision': 0.14047302305698395, 'recall': 0.16943396627902985, 'f1': 0.15628546476364136}"", ""{'precision': -0.1741969883441925, 'recall': -0.2152625024318695, 'f1': -0.19287870824337006}"", ""{'precision': 0.10095961391925812, 'recall': -0.010690257884562016, 'f1': 0.04605867713689804}"", ""{'precision': 0.4403025507926941, 'recall': 0.15784242749214172, 'f1': 0.29640036821365356}"", ""{'precision': 0.1082160696387291, 'recall': -0.02357855811715126, 'f1': 0.043000295758247375}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.0672667920589447, 'recall': 0.34117069840431213, 'f1': 0.20187444984912872}"", ""{'precision': 0.21142058074474335, 'recall': 0.2578919529914856, 'f1': 0.23579636216163635}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.07662168145179749, 'recall': -0.05927005410194397, 'f1': 0.00935102254152298}"", ""{'precision': -0.02370366081595421, 'recall': -0.02631603181362152, 'f1': -0.02334471233189106}"", ""{'precision': 0.3802837133407593, 'recall': 0.37594321370124817, 'f1': 0.37912291288375854}"", ""{'precision': 0.22057241201400757, 'recall': 0.2892892360687256, 'f1': 0.25591564178466797}"", ""{'precision': 0.13475148379802704, 'recall': -0.040554143488407135, 'f1': 0.047102976590394974}"", ""{'precision': 0.2246946543455124, 'recall': 0.10567621141672134, 'f1': 0.16584555804729462}"", ""{'precision': -0.022776130586862564, 'recall': 0.083047054708004, 'f1': 0.031150298193097115}"", ""{'precision': 0.2631351351737976, 'recall': 0.2743387222290039, 'f1': 0.269919216632843}"", ""{'precision': -0.08870362490415573, 'recall': 0.10129321366548538, 'f1': 0.006090278271585703}"", ""{'precision': 0.42749470472335815, 'recall': 0.1397526115179062, 'f1': 0.28082096576690674}"", ""{'precision': 0.06014829874038696, 'recall': 0.12220893800258636, 'f1': 0.09246557205915451}"", ""{'precision': 0.2430046945810318, 'recall': 0.3270018994808197, 'f1': 0.2858295142650604}"", ""{'precision': 0.14836622774600983, 'recall': 0.00877873133867979, 'f1': 0.07909627258777618}"", ""{'precision': 0.2596312463283539, 'recall': 0.2833509147167206, 'f1': 0.2726484537124634}"", ""{'precision': -0.04212549328804016, 'recall': 0.2262428104877472, 'f1': 0.0899641290307045}"", ""{'precision': 0.13963252305984497, 'recall': 0.06494591385126114, 'f1': 0.10346974432468414}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  Directly answer the student's question.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.1387281377207149, 0.0326287712524776, 0.0931273669314074, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3685939814893283, 0.3223659397724296, 0.2835382546816534, 0.0353186986044697, 0.2098288242723427, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1303345371663271, 0.1411195762450153, 0.2307743706703186, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1447803716874165, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0144460941817118, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.0833333333333335, 1.6363636363636365, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7857142857142856, 5.142857142857143, 8.285714285714286, 3.8, 3.6666666666666665, 0.7741935483870968, 0.8857142857142857, 1.2105263157894737, 2.0, 2.3333333333333335, 2.75, 6.8, 6.888888888888889, 3.7, 5.571428571428571, 0.9642857142857144, 1.6521739130434785, 0.92, 3.2857142857142856, 5.111111111111111, 1.4848484848484849, 2.2222222222222223, 4.571428571428571, 1.3666666666666667, 2.727272727272727, 8.75, 2.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.11432495713233948, 'recall': 0.03324726223945618, 'f1': 0.07496145367622375}"", ""{'precision': 0.34705960750579834, 'recall': 0.16323672235012054, 'f1': 0.2547290027141571}"", ""{'precision': -0.04055697098374367, 'recall': 0.13544459640979767, 'f1': 0.047443777322769165}"", ""{'precision': 0.2874433696269989, 'recall': 0.3909418284893036, 'f1': 0.33976122736930847}"", ""{'precision': 0.013704590499401093, 'recall': 0.1261105239391327, 'f1': 0.07079096138477325}"", ""{'precision': 0.0022958312183618546, 'recall': 0.0070695350877940655, 'f1': 0.006298996973782778}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.04759303852915764, 'recall': 0.14297078549861908, 'f1': 0.09630267322063446}"", ""{'precision': 0.5061132907867432, 'recall': 0.3179398477077484, 'f1': 0.4113249182701111}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.3297567069530487, 'recall': 0.20683324337005615, 'f1': 0.268756240606308}"", ""{'precision': 0.0749378353357315, 'recall': 0.11573436856269836, 'f1': 0.09672435373067856}"", ""{'precision': 0.4073179364204407, 'recall': 0.39869120717048645, 'f1': 0.4039713740348816}"", ""{'precision': -0.009095241315662861, 'recall': 0.020507877692580223, 'f1': 0.007277961820363998}"", ""{'precision': -0.06473217904567719, 'recall': -0.034142181277275085, 'f1': -0.047779280692338943}"", ""{'precision': -0.04261331260204315, 'recall': 0.1446707844734192, 'f1': 0.050818946212530136}"", ""{'precision': 0.3305618166923523, 'recall': 0.26773256063461304, 'f1': 0.30009621381759644}"", ""{'precision': -0.031261153519153595, 'recall': 0.018836529925465584, 'f1': -0.004703410901129246}"", ""{'precision': 0.15156836807727814, 'recall': 0.07251915335655212, 'f1': 0.11317533999681473}"", ""{'precision': 0.22911085188388824, 'recall': 0.17426548898220062, 'f1': 0.20283786952495575}"", ""{'precision': 0.24250556528568268, 'recall': 0.2621985375881195, 'f1': 0.2535487413406372}"", ""{'precision': 0.19026708602905273, 'recall': 0.1819763332605362, 'f1': 0.18744036555290222}"", ""{'precision': -0.07508712261915207, 'recall': 0.037153083831071854, 'f1': -0.017948396503925323}"", ""{'precision': 0.2166709154844284, 'recall': 0.17746104300022125, 'f1': 0.19829514622688293}"", ""{'precision': 0.07609530538320541, 'recall': 0.12819607555866241, 'f1': 0.10347115993499756}"", ""{'precision': 0.23566016554832458, 'recall': 0.2002030313014984, 'f1': 0.2191401720046997}"", ""{'precision': 0.039474498480558395, 'recall': 0.03034212253987789, 'f1': 0.03647209703922272}"", ""{'precision': 0.17368051409721375, 'recall': 0.15962590277194977, 'f1': 0.16799703240394592}"", ""{'precision': -0.06723884493112564, 'recall': 0.22073249518871307, 'f1': 0.07412375509738922}"", ""{'precision': 0.13290952146053314, 'recall': 0.07355167716741562, 'f1': 0.1045115739107132}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1231552158867506, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1595867466221573, 0.2816988029230364, 0.0375123027908174, 0.0, 0.121658365925153, 0.0026883850904072, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1601171066931316, 0.0, 0.118127981268613, 0.023413470249148, 0.1743353397675923, 0.017465844953817, 0.0, 0.1669695384489661, 0.1627683104536919, 0.0, 0.0606433872310888, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.1666666666666665, 3.8181818181818183, 1.105263157894737, 4.357142857142857, 8.142857142857142, 8.285714285714286, 6.2, 3.6666666666666665, 1.903225806451613, 1.0285714285714285, 2.5789473684210527, 4.0, 2.8666666666666667, 2.15, 5.8, 4.333333333333333, 2.3, 6.714285714285714, 1.5357142857142858, 2.869565217391304, 1.24, 2.0714285714285716, 3.111111111111111, 1.5454545454545454, 1.037037037037037, 4.714285714285714, 1.2666666666666666, 2.4545454545454546, 2.25, 3.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.10684812068939209, 'recall': 0.03631405159831047, 'f1': 0.07283965498209}"", ""{'precision': 0.18081633746623993, 'recall': 0.21930274367332458, 'f1': 0.20128819346427917}"", ""{'precision': 0.17166095972061157, 'recall': 0.13189461827278137, 'f1': 0.15307734906673431}"", ""{'precision': 0.2035761922597885, 'recall': 0.36162516474723816, 'f1': 0.28257477283477783}"", ""{'precision': -0.007911596447229385, 'recall': 0.07360721379518509, 'f1': 0.03408719226717949}"", ""{'precision': -0.029209056869149208, 'recall': -0.0254511758685112, 'f1': -0.025661807507276535}"", ""{'precision': -0.28529930114746094, 'recall': -0.1471974402666092, 'f1': -0.21527764201164246}"", ""{'precision': 0.06908895075321198, 'recall': 0.19120818376541138, 'f1': 0.1308295577764511}"", ""{'precision': 0.24328982830047607, 'recall': 0.3773156702518463, 'f1': 0.3105713427066803}"", ""{'precision': 0.37962114810943604, 'recall': 0.23239125311374664, 'f1': 0.30609819293022156}"", ""{'precision': 0.14460481703281403, 'recall': 0.2137676626443863, 'f1': 0.18028776347637177}"", ""{'precision': 0.054828621447086334, 'recall': 0.1578940600156784, 'f1': 0.10728989541530609}"", ""{'precision': 0.3231819272041321, 'recall': 0.42914193868637085, 'f1': 0.3766500651836395}"", ""{'precision': 0.06238151714205742, 'recall': 0.07595311105251312, 'f1': 0.07067088782787323}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.040648944675922394, 'recall': 0.0014439028454944491, 'f1': 0.02255857363343239}"", ""{'precision': 0.33503711223602295, 'recall': 0.3662688434123993, 'f1': 0.3516627848148346}"", ""{'precision': -0.0808199793100357, 'recall': 0.04339419677853584, 'f1': -0.017838211730122566}"", ""{'precision': 0.17228850722312927, 'recall': 0.16112887859344482, 'f1': 0.16805635392665863}"", ""{'precision': 0.16065724194049835, 'recall': 0.2842628061771393, 'f1': 0.22298717498779297}"", ""{'precision': 0.19424818456172943, 'recall': 0.25405827164649963, 'f1': 0.22524210810661316}"", ""{'precision': 0.20658765733242035, 'recall': 0.1472964882850647, 'f1': 0.17810629308223724}"", ""{'precision': 0.02119770273566246, 'recall': 0.08223419636487961, 'f1': 0.0530717670917511}"", ""{'precision': 0.3092431426048279, 'recall': 0.23614603281021118, 'f1': 0.273618221282959}"", ""{'precision': 0.15373331308364868, 'recall': 0.1726284623146057, 'f1': 0.16452297568321228}"", ""{'precision': 0.1746618002653122, 'recall': 0.22373667359352112, 'f1': 0.20038409531116486}"", ""{'precision': 0.08880196511745453, 'recall': 0.07461851090192795, 'f1': 0.08319153636693954}"", ""{'precision': 0.1476742923259735, 'recall': 0.07884303480386734, 'f1': 0.11446332186460495}"", ""{'precision': -0.23309831321239471, 'recall': 0.09990908950567245, 'f1': -0.07053916156291962}"", ""{'precision': 0.03019283153116703, 'recall': 0.08091480284929276, 'f1': 0.05696043372154236}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.01413928988305, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.232914392851028, 0.288552621816469, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0777051775670442, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1016052632718472, 0.0, 0.1037397015701301, 0.0456987312059718, 0.0722312220036983, 0.1387480518647602, 0.0, 0.1161288667856411, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0851336600337967, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[5.666666666666667, 2.636363636363636, 2.789473684210526, 3.928571428571429, 6.714285714285714, 6.142857142857143, 7.0, 4.25, 1.4838709677419355, 1.0285714285714285, 2.789473684210526, 3.4, 3.0, 4.9, 5.8, 6.111111111111111, 2.5, 5.142857142857143, 1.5357142857142858, 2.652173913043478, 1.64, 1.1428571428571428, 6.888888888888889, 1.8484848484848484, 3.0, 5.714285714285714, 1.1, 2.909090909090909, 5.125, 2.6818181818181817]","[""{'precision': -0.09311841428279877, 'recall': -0.01294065173715353, 'f1': -0.051645345985889435}"", ""{'precision': 0.2109493762254715, 'recall': 0.20667512714862823, 'f1': 0.21009676158428192}"", ""{'precision': -0.02898159623146057, 'recall': 0.15586157143115997, 'f1': 0.0632597804069519}"", ""{'precision': 0.25616416335105896, 'recall': 0.3921296298503876, 'f1': 0.32437044382095337}"", ""{'precision': -0.03161277994513512, 'recall': 0.057851266115903854, 'f1': 0.014321071095764637}"", ""{'precision': -0.03530910238623619, 'recall': 0.05106435716152191, 'f1': 0.009115110151469707}"", ""{'precision': -0.35257774591445923, 'recall': -0.09080387651920319, 'f1': -0.22332797944545746}"", ""{'precision': 0.01716284081339836, 'recall': 0.16772548854351044, 'f1': 0.09279683977365494}"", ""{'precision': 0.3477271497249603, 'recall': 0.3651588559150696, 'f1': 0.35747477412223816}"", ""{'precision': 0.4063907563686371, 'recall': 0.23384788632392883, 'f1': 0.3198058307170868}"", ""{'precision': 0.09873276203870773, 'recall': 0.18228335678577423, 'f1': 0.14156284928321838}"", ""{'precision': 0.09469754993915558, 'recall': 0.19298988580703735, 'f1': 0.14476250112056732}"", ""{'precision': 0.32154300808906555, 'recall': 0.36767488718032837, 'f1': 0.345574289560318}"", ""{'precision': -0.08242210745811462, 'recall': 0.07026062160730362, 'f1': -0.005622691474854946}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.0636489987373352, 'recall': 0.29298919439315796, 'f1': 0.17709165811538696}"", ""{'precision': 0.32472991943359375, 'recall': 0.4210628569126129, 'f1': 0.37348079681396484}"", ""{'precision': 0.011358527466654778, 'recall': 0.052887097001075745, 'f1': 0.03360971808433533}"", ""{'precision': 0.17086820304393768, 'recall': 0.14884509146213531, 'f1': 0.16119760274887085}"", ""{'precision': 0.18676285445690155, 'recall': 0.2741827070713043, 'f1': 0.23135605454444885}"", ""{'precision': 0.01473683025687933, 'recall': 0.23198658227920532, 'f1': 0.1224624440073967}"", ""{'precision': 0.31424480676651, 'recall': 0.09978776425123215, 'f1': 0.2060675323009491}"", ""{'precision': -0.09696684777736664, 'recall': 0.08984457701444626, 'f1': -0.0036923084408044815}"", ""{'precision': 0.2577022612094879, 'recall': 0.20712047815322876, 'f1': 0.23353365063667297}"", ""{'precision': 0.04533824324607849, 'recall': 0.1415725201368332, 'f1': 0.09447082877159119}"", ""{'precision': 0.15169040858745575, 'recall': 0.21877674758434296, 'f1': 0.18633955717086792}"", ""{'precision': 0.09471594542264938, 'recall': 0.08893232047557831, 'f1': 0.09329762309789658}"", ""{'precision': 0.13611166179180145, 'recall': 0.09732230752706528, 'f1': 0.11807652562856674}"", ""{'precision': -0.1604962795972824, 'recall': 0.15840131044387817, 'f1': -0.00455790851265192}"", ""{'precision': 0.08433659374713898, 'recall': 0.07663544267416, 'f1': 0.08197701722383499}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1035056673507767, 0.0671608869518552, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2584050114622343, 0.3223659397724296, 0.138290599624506, 0.0, 0.1969509557508073, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0986639785766601, 0.0, 0.0018812325738725, 0.0822918270022972, 0.0246503920127183, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0802679530882732, 0.1523317510883013, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0576822277357025]","[3.9166666666666665, 3.636363636363636, 0.4736842105263157, 3.4285714285714284, 10.0, 4.285714285714286, 3.8, 2.5833333333333335, 1.3548387096774193, 0.8857142857142857, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7333333333333334, 2.4, 5.35, 11.0, 4.888888888888889, 2.9, 2.7142857142857144, 1.9642857142857144, 2.260869565217391, 2.0, 2.2857142857142856, 4.333333333333333, 2.060606060606061, 0.925925925925926, 5.0, 1.7666666666666666, 4.2727272727272725, 8.875, 1.5454545454545454]","[""{'precision': 0.018605075776576996, 'recall': 0.027676809579133987, 'f1': 0.024723809212446213}"", ""{'precision': 0.11408830434083939, 'recall': 0.12945179641246796, 'f1': 0.12318607419729233}"", ""{'precision': -0.044818583875894547, 'recall': 0.039317525923252106, 'f1': -0.0014776296447962523}"", ""{'precision': 0.28842395544052124, 'recall': 0.400706022977829, 'f1': 0.3450360596179962}"", ""{'precision': -0.05558670684695244, 'recall': 0.05271483585238457, 'f1': -0.00039977935375645757}"", ""{'precision': 0.16830281913280487, 'recall': 0.07726295292377472, 'f1': 0.12379739433526993}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.017596537247300148, 'recall': 0.0009918430587276816, 'f1': 0.010889396071434021}"", ""{'precision': 0.3915248215198517, 'recall': 0.3192733824253082, 'f1': 0.35619881749153137}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.22101496160030365, 'recall': 0.1334792971611023, 'f1': 0.17820799350738525}"", ""{'precision': 0.1150352880358696, 'recall': 0.19117280840873718, 'f1': 0.1541975736618042}"", ""{'precision': 0.40110504627227783, 'recall': 0.40135687589645386, 'f1': 0.4022037982940674}"", ""{'precision': -0.0658365860581398, 'recall': 0.0735541507601738, 'f1': 0.004498577211052179}"", ""{'precision': -0.07433929294347763, 'recall': -0.10522875189781189, 'f1': -0.08806341141462326}"", ""{'precision': 0.06748929619789124, 'recall': 0.10652444511651993, 'f1': 0.08841516077518463}"", ""{'precision': 0.3841123580932617, 'recall': 0.2892446517944336, 'f1': 0.3373279571533203}"", ""{'precision': 0.03829863667488098, 'recall': 0.039665237069129944, 'f1': 0.04054334759712219}"", ""{'precision': 0.0621151439845562, 'recall': 0.06140831857919693, 'f1': 0.06328627467155457}"", ""{'precision': 0.2234218567609787, 'recall': 0.2235700637102127, 'f1': 0.22475756704807281}"", ""{'precision': 0.09432080388069153, 'recall': 0.19741639494895935, 'f1': 0.14673668146133423}"", ""{'precision': 0.17018228769302368, 'recall': 0.17701993882656097, 'f1': 0.17494195699691772}"", ""{'precision': -0.05711100995540619, 'recall': 0.15987704694271088, 'f1': 0.05057244002819061}"", ""{'precision': 0.1795092225074768, 'recall': 0.22820739448070526, 'f1': 0.20503807067871094}"", ""{'precision': 0.17392954230308533, 'recall': 0.1660403460264206, 'f1': 0.17133016884326935}"", ""{'precision': 0.24478335678577423, 'recall': 0.23942787945270538, 'f1': 0.2433353066444397}"", ""{'precision': 0.051276274025440216, 'recall': 0.03819303587079048, 'f1': 0.04627799242734909}"", ""{'precision': 0.0014669972006231546, 'recall': 0.09220745414495468, 'f1': 0.04797528684139252}"", ""{'precision': -0.14923645555973053, 'recall': 0.13711276650428772, 'f1': -0.008572653867304325}"", ""{'precision': 0.06578033417463303, 'recall': 0.1044427752494812, 'f1': 0.08652433007955551}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use (with examples): ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Format your answer as follows: (Teaching Method) (Response) Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.280274337093472, 0.0595901505578131, 0.0634508564975691, 0.0, 0.1072481046120325, 0.2331032305449905, 0.1887971609447683, 0.4482468976384072, 0.218167631398606, 0.2372445311148961, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1737546155282429, 0.1121535111154828, 0.1455629308592705, 0.2691694521503486, 0.0387265856899321, 0.1543118895803178, 0.1429861229229596, 0.2223921435844164, 0.1244109327523227, 0.0, 0.1376201412853196, 0.0359484198870081, 0.0885679996609688, 0.1497610494494438]","[2.4166666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 1.7142857142857142, 1.8571428571428572, 2.142857142857143, 2.4, 1.5833333333333333, 0.8064516129032258, 0.3714285714285714, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 3.0, 1.8888888888888888, 1.7, 2.4285714285714284, 1.1071428571428572, 0.9130434782608696, 0.56, 1.4285714285714286, 0.7777777777777778, 0.8181818181818182, 1.2592592592592593, 1.8571428571428572, 0.5333333333333333, 2.090909090909091, 1.875, 0.9090909090909092]","[""{'precision': 0.13864237070083618, 'recall': 0.22377946972846985, 'f1': 0.18218955397605896}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.29420068860054016, 'recall': 0.45664507150650024, 'f1': 0.37520068883895874}"", ""{'precision': 0.13351726531982422, 'recall': 0.29529616236686707, 'f1': 0.21441839635372162}"", ""{'precision': 0.29231661558151245, 'recall': 0.2771975100040436, 'f1': 0.28590792417526245}"", ""{'precision': -0.16725677251815796, 'recall': -0.02978040836751461, 'f1': -0.09770578891038895}"", ""{'precision': 0.218782439827919, 'recall': 0.24108827114105225, 'f1': 0.2311628758907318}"", ""{'precision': 0.24765720963478088, 'recall': 0.2681216597557068, 'f1': 0.25907573103904724}"", ""{'precision': 0.17579273879528046, 'recall': 0.0702231302857399, 'f1': 0.12388003617525101}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.08622314035892487, 'recall': 0.32667577266693115, 'f1': 0.2049374133348465}"", ""{'precision': 0.25753599405288696, 'recall': 0.3161171078681946, 'f1': 0.2878223955631256}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.13379955291748047, 'recall': 0.09721406549215317, 'f1': 0.11687683314085007}"", ""{'precision': 0.015880854800343513, 'recall': 0.0830654427409172, 'f1': 0.05079316720366478}"", ""{'precision': 0.23008720576763153, 'recall': 0.4026769995689392, 'f1': 0.31608065962791443}"", ""{'precision': 0.296329528093338, 'recall': 0.46848103404045105, 'f1': 0.38202130794525146}"", ""{'precision': 0.12538881599903107, 'recall': 0.12354177236557007, 'f1': 0.12588776648044586}"", ""{'precision': 0.3607337772846222, 'recall': 0.31556951999664307, 'f1': 0.33912941813468933}"", ""{'precision': -0.07983797043561935, 'recall': 0.057360295206308365, 'f1': -0.010546828620135784}"", ""{'precision': 0.31597214937210083, 'recall': 0.2876557409763336, 'f1': 0.3029094934463501}"", ""{'precision': 0.09233592450618744, 'recall': 0.2008637934923172, 'f1': 0.14741015434265137}"", ""{'precision': 0.22945044934749603, 'recall': 0.2754858434200287, 'f1': 0.2535819411277771}"", ""{'precision': 0.1828542798757553, 'recall': 0.2094971388578415, 'f1': 0.19744791090488434}"", ""{'precision': 0.10266786813735962, 'recall': 0.19699440896511078, 'f1': 0.1507779061794281}"", ""{'precision': 0.10981395095586777, 'recall': 0.047144029289484024, 'f1': 0.07977928966283798}"", ""{'precision': 0.09698135405778885, 'recall': 0.290243923664093, 'f1': 0.1931089609861374}"", ""{'precision': 0.07298797369003296, 'recall': 0.2475324124097824, 'f1': 0.16013599932193756}"", ""{'precision': 0.09527769684791565, 'recall': 0.10083868354558945, 'f1': 0.09952209889888763}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.0602024057870188, 0.0369230996710913, 0.0334222354874107, 0.0, 0.0172822121316674, 0.2822177794147447, 0.1264396151914723, 0.4482468976384072, 0.2166361496557471, 0.2112315144141515, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1458772459155634, 0.0484547153022719, 0.0976198112765639, 0.1287198804729226, 0.0252047787261781, 0.0963881797449929, 0.0319340280246817, 0.2765885904901324, 0.0176132574100486, 0.0, 0.1542999093435335, 0.2538067443387491, 0.0, 0.1461071665346364]","[2.1666666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 2.7142857142857144, 1.7142857142857142, 2.142857142857143, 1.4, 1.3333333333333333, 0.3870967741935484, 0.6285714285714286, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 4.8, 1.5555555555555556, 2.7, 2.142857142857143, 0.6071428571428571, 1.608695652173913, 1.2, 1.7857142857142858, 1.1111111111111112, 0.4545454545454545, 1.4074074074074074, 3.2857142857142856, 0.5333333333333333, 1.3636363636363635, 5.125, 0.8181818181818182]","[""{'precision': 0.11144650727510452, 'recall': 0.16678740084171295, 'f1': 0.1403663456439972}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.16733106970787048, 'recall': 0.34498879313468933, 'f1': 0.2558545470237732}"", ""{'precision': 0.14777971804141998, 'recall': 0.12287995219230652, 'f1': 0.13670334219932556}"", ""{'precision': 0.14047302305698395, 'recall': 0.16943396627902985, 'f1': 0.15628546476364136}"", ""{'precision': -0.1741969883441925, 'recall': -0.2152625024318695, 'f1': -0.19287870824337006}"", ""{'precision': 0.10095961391925812, 'recall': -0.010690257884562016, 'f1': 0.04605867713689804}"", ""{'precision': 0.4403025507926941, 'recall': 0.15784242749214172, 'f1': 0.29640036821365356}"", ""{'precision': 0.1082160696387291, 'recall': -0.02357855811715126, 'f1': 0.043000295758247375}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.0672667920589447, 'recall': 0.34117069840431213, 'f1': 0.20187444984912872}"", ""{'precision': 0.21142058074474335, 'recall': 0.2578919529914856, 'f1': 0.23579636216163635}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.07662168145179749, 'recall': -0.05927005410194397, 'f1': 0.00935102254152298}"", ""{'precision': -0.02370366081595421, 'recall': -0.02631603181362152, 'f1': -0.02334471233189106}"", ""{'precision': 0.3802837133407593, 'recall': 0.37594321370124817, 'f1': 0.37912291288375854}"", ""{'precision': 0.22057241201400757, 'recall': 0.2892892360687256, 'f1': 0.25591564178466797}"", ""{'precision': 0.13475148379802704, 'recall': -0.040554143488407135, 'f1': 0.047102976590394974}"", ""{'precision': 0.2246946543455124, 'recall': 0.10567621141672134, 'f1': 0.16584555804729462}"", ""{'precision': -0.022776130586862564, 'recall': 0.083047054708004, 'f1': 0.031150298193097115}"", ""{'precision': 0.2631351351737976, 'recall': 0.2743387222290039, 'f1': 0.269919216632843}"", ""{'precision': -0.08870362490415573, 'recall': 0.10129321366548538, 'f1': 0.006090278271585703}"", ""{'precision': 0.42749470472335815, 'recall': 0.1397526115179062, 'f1': 0.28082096576690674}"", ""{'precision': 0.06014829874038696, 'recall': 0.12220893800258636, 'f1': 0.09246557205915451}"", ""{'precision': 0.2430046945810318, 'recall': 0.3270018994808197, 'f1': 0.2858295142650604}"", ""{'precision': 0.14836622774600983, 'recall': 0.00877873133867979, 'f1': 0.07909627258777618}"", ""{'precision': 0.2596312463283539, 'recall': 0.2833509147167206, 'f1': 0.2726484537124634}"", ""{'precision': -0.04212549328804016, 'recall': 0.2262428104877472, 'f1': 0.0899641290307045}"", ""{'precision': 0.13963252305984497, 'recall': 0.06494591385126114, 'f1': 0.10346974432468414}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  Directly answer the student's question.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.1387281377207149, 0.0326287712524776, 0.0931273669314074, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3685939814893283, 0.3223659397724296, 0.2835382546816534, 0.0353186986044697, 0.2098288242723427, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1303345371663271, 0.1411195762450153, 0.2307743706703186, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1447803716874165, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0144460941817118, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.0833333333333335, 1.6363636363636365, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7857142857142856, 5.142857142857143, 8.285714285714286, 3.8, 3.6666666666666665, 0.7741935483870968, 0.8857142857142857, 1.2105263157894737, 2.0, 2.3333333333333335, 2.75, 6.8, 6.888888888888889, 3.7, 5.571428571428571, 0.9642857142857144, 1.6521739130434785, 0.92, 3.2857142857142856, 5.111111111111111, 1.4848484848484849, 2.2222222222222223, 4.571428571428571, 1.3666666666666667, 2.727272727272727, 8.75, 2.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.11432495713233948, 'recall': 0.03324726223945618, 'f1': 0.07496145367622375}"", ""{'precision': 0.34705960750579834, 'recall': 0.16323672235012054, 'f1': 0.2547290027141571}"", ""{'precision': -0.04055697098374367, 'recall': 0.13544459640979767, 'f1': 0.047443777322769165}"", ""{'precision': 0.2874433696269989, 'recall': 0.3909418284893036, 'f1': 0.33976122736930847}"", ""{'precision': 0.013704590499401093, 'recall': 0.1261105239391327, 'f1': 0.07079096138477325}"", ""{'precision': 0.0022958312183618546, 'recall': 0.0070695350877940655, 'f1': 0.006298996973782778}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.04759303852915764, 'recall': 0.14297078549861908, 'f1': 0.09630267322063446}"", ""{'precision': 0.5061132907867432, 'recall': 0.3179398477077484, 'f1': 0.4113249182701111}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.3297567069530487, 'recall': 0.20683324337005615, 'f1': 0.268756240606308}"", ""{'precision': 0.0749378353357315, 'recall': 0.11573436856269836, 'f1': 0.09672435373067856}"", ""{'precision': 0.4073179364204407, 'recall': 0.39869120717048645, 'f1': 0.4039713740348816}"", ""{'precision': -0.009095241315662861, 'recall': 0.020507877692580223, 'f1': 0.007277961820363998}"", ""{'precision': -0.06473217904567719, 'recall': -0.034142181277275085, 'f1': -0.047779280692338943}"", ""{'precision': -0.04261331260204315, 'recall': 0.1446707844734192, 'f1': 0.050818946212530136}"", ""{'precision': 0.3305618166923523, 'recall': 0.26773256063461304, 'f1': 0.30009621381759644}"", ""{'precision': -0.031261153519153595, 'recall': 0.018836529925465584, 'f1': -0.004703410901129246}"", ""{'precision': 0.15156836807727814, 'recall': 0.07251915335655212, 'f1': 0.11317533999681473}"", ""{'precision': 0.22911085188388824, 'recall': 0.17426548898220062, 'f1': 0.20283786952495575}"", ""{'precision': 0.24250556528568268, 'recall': 0.2621985375881195, 'f1': 0.2535487413406372}"", ""{'precision': 0.19026708602905273, 'recall': 0.1819763332605362, 'f1': 0.18744036555290222}"", ""{'precision': -0.07508712261915207, 'recall': 0.037153083831071854, 'f1': -0.017948396503925323}"", ""{'precision': 0.2166709154844284, 'recall': 0.17746104300022125, 'f1': 0.19829514622688293}"", ""{'precision': 0.07609530538320541, 'recall': 0.12819607555866241, 'f1': 0.10347115993499756}"", ""{'precision': 0.23566016554832458, 'recall': 0.2002030313014984, 'f1': 0.2191401720046997}"", ""{'precision': 0.039474498480558395, 'recall': 0.03034212253987789, 'f1': 0.03647209703922272}"", ""{'precision': 0.17368051409721375, 'recall': 0.15962590277194977, 'f1': 0.16799703240394592}"", ""{'precision': -0.06723884493112564, 'recall': 0.22073249518871307, 'f1': 0.07412375509738922}"", ""{'precision': 0.13290952146053314, 'recall': 0.07355167716741562, 'f1': 0.1045115739107132}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1231552158867506, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1595867466221573, 0.2816988029230364, 0.0375123027908174, 0.0, 0.121658365925153, 0.0026883850904072, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1601171066931316, 0.0, 0.118127981268613, 0.023413470249148, 0.1743353397675923, 0.017465844953817, 0.0, 0.1669695384489661, 0.1627683104536919, 0.0, 0.0606433872310888, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.1666666666666665, 3.8181818181818183, 1.105263157894737, 4.357142857142857, 8.142857142857142, 8.285714285714286, 6.2, 3.6666666666666665, 1.903225806451613, 1.0285714285714285, 2.5789473684210527, 4.0, 2.8666666666666667, 2.15, 5.8, 4.333333333333333, 2.3, 6.714285714285714, 1.5357142857142858, 2.869565217391304, 1.24, 2.0714285714285716, 3.111111111111111, 1.5454545454545454, 1.037037037037037, 4.714285714285714, 1.2666666666666666, 2.4545454545454546, 2.25, 3.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.10684812068939209, 'recall': 0.03631405159831047, 'f1': 0.07283965498209}"", ""{'precision': 0.18081633746623993, 'recall': 0.21930274367332458, 'f1': 0.20128819346427917}"", ""{'precision': 0.17166095972061157, 'recall': 0.13189461827278137, 'f1': 0.15307734906673431}"", ""{'precision': 0.2035761922597885, 'recall': 0.36162516474723816, 'f1': 0.28257477283477783}"", ""{'precision': -0.007911596447229385, 'recall': 0.07360721379518509, 'f1': 0.03408719226717949}"", ""{'precision': -0.029209056869149208, 'recall': -0.0254511758685112, 'f1': -0.025661807507276535}"", ""{'precision': -0.28529930114746094, 'recall': -0.1471974402666092, 'f1': -0.21527764201164246}"", ""{'precision': 0.06908895075321198, 'recall': 0.19120818376541138, 'f1': 0.1308295577764511}"", ""{'precision': 0.24328982830047607, 'recall': 0.3773156702518463, 'f1': 0.3105713427066803}"", ""{'precision': 0.37962114810943604, 'recall': 0.23239125311374664, 'f1': 0.30609819293022156}"", ""{'precision': 0.14460481703281403, 'recall': 0.2137676626443863, 'f1': 0.18028776347637177}"", ""{'precision': 0.054828621447086334, 'recall': 0.1578940600156784, 'f1': 0.10728989541530609}"", ""{'precision': 0.3231819272041321, 'recall': 0.42914193868637085, 'f1': 0.3766500651836395}"", ""{'precision': 0.06238151714205742, 'recall': 0.07595311105251312, 'f1': 0.07067088782787323}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.040648944675922394, 'recall': 0.0014439028454944491, 'f1': 0.02255857363343239}"", ""{'precision': 0.33503711223602295, 'recall': 0.3662688434123993, 'f1': 0.3516627848148346}"", ""{'precision': -0.0808199793100357, 'recall': 0.04339419677853584, 'f1': -0.017838211730122566}"", ""{'precision': 0.17228850722312927, 'recall': 0.16112887859344482, 'f1': 0.16805635392665863}"", ""{'precision': 0.16065724194049835, 'recall': 0.2842628061771393, 'f1': 0.22298717498779297}"", ""{'precision': 0.19424818456172943, 'recall': 0.25405827164649963, 'f1': 0.22524210810661316}"", ""{'precision': 0.20658765733242035, 'recall': 0.1472964882850647, 'f1': 0.17810629308223724}"", ""{'precision': 0.02119770273566246, 'recall': 0.08223419636487961, 'f1': 0.0530717670917511}"", ""{'precision': 0.3092431426048279, 'recall': 0.23614603281021118, 'f1': 0.273618221282959}"", ""{'precision': 0.15373331308364868, 'recall': 0.1726284623146057, 'f1': 0.16452297568321228}"", ""{'precision': 0.1746618002653122, 'recall': 0.22373667359352112, 'f1': 0.20038409531116486}"", ""{'precision': 0.08880196511745453, 'recall': 0.07461851090192795, 'f1': 0.08319153636693954}"", ""{'precision': 0.1476742923259735, 'recall': 0.07884303480386734, 'f1': 0.11446332186460495}"", ""{'precision': -0.23309831321239471, 'recall': 0.09990908950567245, 'f1': -0.07053916156291962}"", ""{'precision': 0.03019283153116703, 'recall': 0.08091480284929276, 'f1': 0.05696043372154236}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.01413928988305, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.232914392851028, 0.288552621816469, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0777051775670442, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1016052632718472, 0.0, 0.1037397015701301, 0.0456987312059718, 0.0722312220036983, 0.1387480518647602, 0.0, 0.1161288667856411, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0851336600337967, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[5.666666666666667, 2.636363636363636, 2.789473684210526, 3.928571428571429, 6.714285714285714, 6.142857142857143, 7.0, 4.25, 1.4838709677419355, 1.0285714285714285, 2.789473684210526, 3.4, 3.0, 4.9, 5.8, 6.111111111111111, 2.5, 5.142857142857143, 1.5357142857142858, 2.652173913043478, 1.64, 1.1428571428571428, 6.888888888888889, 1.8484848484848484, 3.0, 5.714285714285714, 1.1, 2.909090909090909, 5.125, 2.6818181818181817]","[""{'precision': -0.09311841428279877, 'recall': -0.01294065173715353, 'f1': -0.051645345985889435}"", ""{'precision': 0.2109493762254715, 'recall': 0.20667512714862823, 'f1': 0.21009676158428192}"", ""{'precision': -0.02898159623146057, 'recall': 0.15586157143115997, 'f1': 0.0632597804069519}"", ""{'precision': 0.25616416335105896, 'recall': 0.3921296298503876, 'f1': 0.32437044382095337}"", ""{'precision': -0.03161277994513512, 'recall': 0.057851266115903854, 'f1': 0.014321071095764637}"", ""{'precision': -0.03530910238623619, 'recall': 0.05106435716152191, 'f1': 0.009115110151469707}"", ""{'precision': -0.35257774591445923, 'recall': -0.09080387651920319, 'f1': -0.22332797944545746}"", ""{'precision': 0.01716284081339836, 'recall': 0.16772548854351044, 'f1': 0.09279683977365494}"", ""{'precision': 0.3477271497249603, 'recall': 0.3651588559150696, 'f1': 0.35747477412223816}"", ""{'precision': 0.4063907563686371, 'recall': 0.23384788632392883, 'f1': 0.3198058307170868}"", ""{'precision': 0.09873276203870773, 'recall': 0.18228335678577423, 'f1': 0.14156284928321838}"", ""{'precision': 0.09469754993915558, 'recall': 0.19298988580703735, 'f1': 0.14476250112056732}"", ""{'precision': 0.32154300808906555, 'recall': 0.36767488718032837, 'f1': 0.345574289560318}"", ""{'precision': -0.08242210745811462, 'recall': 0.07026062160730362, 'f1': -0.005622691474854946}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.0636489987373352, 'recall': 0.29298919439315796, 'f1': 0.17709165811538696}"", ""{'precision': 0.32472991943359375, 'recall': 0.4210628569126129, 'f1': 0.37348079681396484}"", ""{'precision': 0.011358527466654778, 'recall': 0.052887097001075745, 'f1': 0.03360971808433533}"", ""{'precision': 0.17086820304393768, 'recall': 0.14884509146213531, 'f1': 0.16119760274887085}"", ""{'precision': 0.18676285445690155, 'recall': 0.2741827070713043, 'f1': 0.23135605454444885}"", ""{'precision': 0.01473683025687933, 'recall': 0.23198658227920532, 'f1': 0.1224624440073967}"", ""{'precision': 0.31424480676651, 'recall': 0.09978776425123215, 'f1': 0.2060675323009491}"", ""{'precision': -0.09696684777736664, 'recall': 0.08984457701444626, 'f1': -0.0036923084408044815}"", ""{'precision': 0.2577022612094879, 'recall': 0.20712047815322876, 'f1': 0.23353365063667297}"", ""{'precision': 0.04533824324607849, 'recall': 0.1415725201368332, 'f1': 0.09447082877159119}"", ""{'precision': 0.15169040858745575, 'recall': 0.21877674758434296, 'f1': 0.18633955717086792}"", ""{'precision': 0.09471594542264938, 'recall': 0.08893232047557831, 'f1': 0.09329762309789658}"", ""{'precision': 0.13611166179180145, 'recall': 0.09732230752706528, 'f1': 0.11807652562856674}"", ""{'precision': -0.1604962795972824, 'recall': 0.15840131044387817, 'f1': -0.00455790851265192}"", ""{'precision': 0.08433659374713898, 'recall': 0.07663544267416, 'f1': 0.08197701722383499}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1035056673507767, 0.0671608869518552, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2584050114622343, 0.3223659397724296, 0.138290599624506, 0.0, 0.1969509557508073, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0986639785766601, 0.0, 0.0018812325738725, 0.0822918270022972, 0.0246503920127183, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0802679530882732, 0.1523317510883013, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0576822277357025]","[3.9166666666666665, 3.636363636363636, 0.4736842105263157, 3.4285714285714284, 10.0, 4.285714285714286, 3.8, 2.5833333333333335, 1.3548387096774193, 0.8857142857142857, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7333333333333334, 2.4, 5.35, 11.0, 4.888888888888889, 2.9, 2.7142857142857144, 1.9642857142857144, 2.260869565217391, 2.0, 2.2857142857142856, 4.333333333333333, 2.060606060606061, 0.925925925925926, 5.0, 1.7666666666666666, 4.2727272727272725, 8.875, 1.5454545454545454]","[""{'precision': 0.018605075776576996, 'recall': 0.027676809579133987, 'f1': 0.024723809212446213}"", ""{'precision': 0.11408830434083939, 'recall': 0.12945179641246796, 'f1': 0.12318607419729233}"", ""{'precision': -0.044818583875894547, 'recall': 0.039317525923252106, 'f1': -0.0014776296447962523}"", ""{'precision': 0.28842395544052124, 'recall': 0.400706022977829, 'f1': 0.3450360596179962}"", ""{'precision': -0.05558670684695244, 'recall': 0.05271483585238457, 'f1': -0.00039977935375645757}"", ""{'precision': 0.16830281913280487, 'recall': 0.07726295292377472, 'f1': 0.12379739433526993}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.017596537247300148, 'recall': 0.0009918430587276816, 'f1': 0.010889396071434021}"", ""{'precision': 0.3915248215198517, 'recall': 0.3192733824253082, 'f1': 0.35619881749153137}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.22101496160030365, 'recall': 0.1334792971611023, 'f1': 0.17820799350738525}"", ""{'precision': 0.1150352880358696, 'recall': 0.19117280840873718, 'f1': 0.1541975736618042}"", ""{'precision': 0.40110504627227783, 'recall': 0.40135687589645386, 'f1': 0.4022037982940674}"", ""{'precision': -0.0658365860581398, 'recall': 0.0735541507601738, 'f1': 0.004498577211052179}"", ""{'precision': -0.07433929294347763, 'recall': -0.10522875189781189, 'f1': -0.08806341141462326}"", ""{'precision': 0.06748929619789124, 'recall': 0.10652444511651993, 'f1': 0.08841516077518463}"", ""{'precision': 0.3841123580932617, 'recall': 0.2892446517944336, 'f1': 0.3373279571533203}"", ""{'precision': 0.03829863667488098, 'recall': 0.039665237069129944, 'f1': 0.04054334759712219}"", ""{'precision': 0.0621151439845562, 'recall': 0.06140831857919693, 'f1': 0.06328627467155457}"", ""{'precision': 0.2234218567609787, 'recall': 0.2235700637102127, 'f1': 0.22475756704807281}"", ""{'precision': 0.09432080388069153, 'recall': 0.19741639494895935, 'f1': 0.14673668146133423}"", ""{'precision': 0.17018228769302368, 'recall': 0.17701993882656097, 'f1': 0.17494195699691772}"", ""{'precision': -0.05711100995540619, 'recall': 0.15987704694271088, 'f1': 0.05057244002819061}"", ""{'precision': 0.1795092225074768, 'recall': 0.22820739448070526, 'f1': 0.20503807067871094}"", ""{'precision': 0.17392954230308533, 'recall': 0.1660403460264206, 'f1': 0.17133016884326935}"", ""{'precision': 0.24478335678577423, 'recall': 0.23942787945270538, 'f1': 0.2433353066444397}"", ""{'precision': 0.051276274025440216, 'recall': 0.03819303587079048, 'f1': 0.04627799242734909}"", ""{'precision': 0.0014669972006231546, 'recall': 0.09220745414495468, 'f1': 0.04797528684139252}"", ""{'precision': -0.14923645555973053, 'recall': 0.13711276650428772, 'f1': -0.008572653867304325}"", ""{'precision': 0.06578033417463303, 'recall': 0.1044427752494812, 'f1': 0.08652433007955551}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use (with examples): ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Format your answer as follows: (Teaching Method) (Response) Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.280274337093472, 0.0595901505578131, 0.0634508564975691, 0.0, 0.1072481046120325, 0.2331032305449905, 0.1887971609447683, 0.4482468976384072, 0.218167631398606, 0.2372445311148961, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1737546155282429, 0.1121535111154828, 0.1455629308592705, 0.2691694521503486, 0.0387265856899321, 0.1543118895803178, 0.1429861229229596, 0.2223921435844164, 0.1244109327523227, 0.0, 0.1376201412853196, 0.0359484198870081, 0.0885679996609688, 0.1497610494494438]","[2.4166666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 1.7142857142857142, 1.8571428571428572, 2.142857142857143, 2.4, 1.5833333333333333, 0.8064516129032258, 0.3714285714285714, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 3.0, 1.8888888888888888, 1.7, 2.4285714285714284, 1.1071428571428572, 0.9130434782608696, 0.56, 1.4285714285714286, 0.7777777777777778, 0.8181818181818182, 1.2592592592592593, 1.8571428571428572, 0.5333333333333333, 2.090909090909091, 1.875, 0.9090909090909092]","[""{'precision': 0.13864237070083618, 'recall': 0.22377946972846985, 'f1': 0.18218955397605896}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.29420068860054016, 'recall': 0.45664507150650024, 'f1': 0.37520068883895874}"", ""{'precision': 0.13351726531982422, 'recall': 0.29529616236686707, 'f1': 0.21441839635372162}"", ""{'precision': 0.29231661558151245, 'recall': 0.2771975100040436, 'f1': 0.28590792417526245}"", ""{'precision': -0.16725677251815796, 'recall': -0.02978040836751461, 'f1': -0.09770578891038895}"", ""{'precision': 0.218782439827919, 'recall': 0.24108827114105225, 'f1': 0.2311628758907318}"", ""{'precision': 0.24765720963478088, 'recall': 0.2681216597557068, 'f1': 0.25907573103904724}"", ""{'precision': 0.17579273879528046, 'recall': 0.0702231302857399, 'f1': 0.12388003617525101}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.08622314035892487, 'recall': 0.32667577266693115, 'f1': 0.2049374133348465}"", ""{'precision': 0.25753599405288696, 'recall': 0.3161171078681946, 'f1': 0.2878223955631256}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.13379955291748047, 'recall': 0.09721406549215317, 'f1': 0.11687683314085007}"", ""{'precision': 0.015880854800343513, 'recall': 0.0830654427409172, 'f1': 0.05079316720366478}"", ""{'precision': 0.23008720576763153, 'recall': 0.4026769995689392, 'f1': 0.31608065962791443}"", ""{'precision': 0.296329528093338, 'recall': 0.46848103404045105, 'f1': 0.38202130794525146}"", ""{'precision': 0.12538881599903107, 'recall': 0.12354177236557007, 'f1': 0.12588776648044586}"", ""{'precision': 0.3607337772846222, 'recall': 0.31556951999664307, 'f1': 0.33912941813468933}"", ""{'precision': -0.07983797043561935, 'recall': 0.057360295206308365, 'f1': -0.010546828620135784}"", ""{'precision': 0.31597214937210083, 'recall': 0.2876557409763336, 'f1': 0.3029094934463501}"", ""{'precision': 0.09233592450618744, 'recall': 0.2008637934923172, 'f1': 0.14741015434265137}"", ""{'precision': 0.22945044934749603, 'recall': 0.2754858434200287, 'f1': 0.2535819411277771}"", ""{'precision': 0.1828542798757553, 'recall': 0.2094971388578415, 'f1': 0.19744791090488434}"", ""{'precision': 0.10266786813735962, 'recall': 0.19699440896511078, 'f1': 0.1507779061794281}"", ""{'precision': 0.10981395095586777, 'recall': 0.047144029289484024, 'f1': 0.07977928966283798}"", ""{'precision': 0.09698135405778885, 'recall': 0.290243923664093, 'f1': 0.1931089609861374}"", ""{'precision': 0.07298797369003296, 'recall': 0.2475324124097824, 'f1': 0.16013599932193756}"", ""{'precision': 0.09527769684791565, 'recall': 0.10083868354558945, 'f1': 0.09952209889888763}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.0602024057870188, 0.0369230996710913, 0.0334222354874107, 0.0, 0.0172822121316674, 0.2822177794147447, 0.1264396151914723, 0.4482468976384072, 0.2166361496557471, 0.2112315144141515, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1458772459155634, 0.0484547153022719, 0.0976198112765639, 0.1287198804729226, 0.0252047787261781, 0.0963881797449929, 0.0319340280246817, 0.2765885904901324, 0.0176132574100486, 0.0, 0.1542999093435335, 0.2538067443387491, 0.0, 0.1461071665346364]","[2.1666666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 2.7142857142857144, 1.7142857142857142, 2.142857142857143, 1.4, 1.3333333333333333, 0.3870967741935484, 0.6285714285714286, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 4.8, 1.5555555555555556, 2.7, 2.142857142857143, 0.6071428571428571, 1.608695652173913, 1.2, 1.7857142857142858, 1.1111111111111112, 0.4545454545454545, 1.4074074074074074, 3.2857142857142856, 0.5333333333333333, 1.3636363636363635, 5.125, 0.8181818181818182]","[""{'precision': 0.11144650727510452, 'recall': 0.16678740084171295, 'f1': 0.1403663456439972}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.16733106970787048, 'recall': 0.34498879313468933, 'f1': 0.2558545470237732}"", ""{'precision': 0.14777971804141998, 'recall': 0.12287995219230652, 'f1': 0.13670334219932556}"", ""{'precision': 0.14047302305698395, 'recall': 0.16943396627902985, 'f1': 0.15628546476364136}"", ""{'precision': -0.1741969883441925, 'recall': -0.2152625024318695, 'f1': -0.19287870824337006}"", ""{'precision': 0.10095961391925812, 'recall': -0.010690257884562016, 'f1': 0.04605867713689804}"", ""{'precision': 0.4403025507926941, 'recall': 0.15784242749214172, 'f1': 0.29640036821365356}"", ""{'precision': 0.1082160696387291, 'recall': -0.02357855811715126, 'f1': 0.043000295758247375}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.0672667920589447, 'recall': 0.34117069840431213, 'f1': 0.20187444984912872}"", ""{'precision': 0.21142058074474335, 'recall': 0.2578919529914856, 'f1': 0.23579636216163635}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.07662168145179749, 'recall': -0.05927005410194397, 'f1': 0.00935102254152298}"", ""{'precision': -0.02370366081595421, 'recall': -0.02631603181362152, 'f1': -0.02334471233189106}"", ""{'precision': 0.3802837133407593, 'recall': 0.37594321370124817, 'f1': 0.37912291288375854}"", ""{'precision': 0.22057241201400757, 'recall': 0.2892892360687256, 'f1': 0.25591564178466797}"", ""{'precision': 0.13475148379802704, 'recall': -0.040554143488407135, 'f1': 0.047102976590394974}"", ""{'precision': 0.2246946543455124, 'recall': 0.10567621141672134, 'f1': 0.16584555804729462}"", ""{'precision': -0.022776130586862564, 'recall': 0.083047054708004, 'f1': 0.031150298193097115}"", ""{'precision': 0.2631351351737976, 'recall': 0.2743387222290039, 'f1': 0.269919216632843}"", ""{'precision': -0.08870362490415573, 'recall': 0.10129321366548538, 'f1': 0.006090278271585703}"", ""{'precision': 0.42749470472335815, 'recall': 0.1397526115179062, 'f1': 0.28082096576690674}"", ""{'precision': 0.06014829874038696, 'recall': 0.12220893800258636, 'f1': 0.09246557205915451}"", ""{'precision': 0.2430046945810318, 'recall': 0.3270018994808197, 'f1': 0.2858295142650604}"", ""{'precision': 0.14836622774600983, 'recall': 0.00877873133867979, 'f1': 0.07909627258777618}"", ""{'precision': 0.2596312463283539, 'recall': 0.2833509147167206, 'f1': 0.2726484537124634}"", ""{'precision': -0.04212549328804016, 'recall': 0.2262428104877472, 'f1': 0.0899641290307045}"", ""{'precision': 0.13963252305984497, 'recall': 0.06494591385126114, 'f1': 0.10346974432468414}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  Directly answer the student's question.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.1387281377207149, 0.0326287712524776, 0.0931273669314074, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3685939814893283, 0.3223659397724296, 0.2835382546816534, 0.0353186986044697, 0.2098288242723427, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1303345371663271, 0.1411195762450153, 0.2307743706703186, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1447803716874165, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0144460941817118, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.0833333333333335, 1.6363636363636365, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7857142857142856, 5.142857142857143, 8.285714285714286, 3.8, 3.6666666666666665, 0.7741935483870968, 0.8857142857142857, 1.2105263157894737, 2.0, 2.3333333333333335, 2.75, 6.8, 6.888888888888889, 3.7, 5.571428571428571, 0.9642857142857144, 1.6521739130434785, 0.92, 3.2857142857142856, 5.111111111111111, 1.4848484848484849, 2.2222222222222223, 4.571428571428571, 1.3666666666666667, 2.727272727272727, 8.75, 2.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.11432495713233948, 'recall': 0.03324726223945618, 'f1': 0.07496145367622375}"", ""{'precision': 0.34705960750579834, 'recall': 0.16323672235012054, 'f1': 0.2547290027141571}"", ""{'precision': -0.04055697098374367, 'recall': 0.13544459640979767, 'f1': 0.047443777322769165}"", ""{'precision': 0.2874433696269989, 'recall': 0.3909418284893036, 'f1': 0.33976122736930847}"", ""{'precision': 0.013704590499401093, 'recall': 0.1261105239391327, 'f1': 0.07079096138477325}"", ""{'precision': 0.0022958312183618546, 'recall': 0.0070695350877940655, 'f1': 0.006298996973782778}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.04759303852915764, 'recall': 0.14297078549861908, 'f1': 0.09630267322063446}"", ""{'precision': 0.5061132907867432, 'recall': 0.3179398477077484, 'f1': 0.4113249182701111}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.3297567069530487, 'recall': 0.20683324337005615, 'f1': 0.268756240606308}"", ""{'precision': 0.0749378353357315, 'recall': 0.11573436856269836, 'f1': 0.09672435373067856}"", ""{'precision': 0.4073179364204407, 'recall': 0.39869120717048645, 'f1': 0.4039713740348816}"", ""{'precision': -0.009095241315662861, 'recall': 0.020507877692580223, 'f1': 0.007277961820363998}"", ""{'precision': -0.06473217904567719, 'recall': -0.034142181277275085, 'f1': -0.047779280692338943}"", ""{'precision': -0.04261331260204315, 'recall': 0.1446707844734192, 'f1': 0.050818946212530136}"", ""{'precision': 0.3305618166923523, 'recall': 0.26773256063461304, 'f1': 0.30009621381759644}"", ""{'precision': -0.031261153519153595, 'recall': 0.018836529925465584, 'f1': -0.004703410901129246}"", ""{'precision': 0.15156836807727814, 'recall': 0.07251915335655212, 'f1': 0.11317533999681473}"", ""{'precision': 0.22911085188388824, 'recall': 0.17426548898220062, 'f1': 0.20283786952495575}"", ""{'precision': 0.24250556528568268, 'recall': 0.2621985375881195, 'f1': 0.2535487413406372}"", ""{'precision': 0.19026708602905273, 'recall': 0.1819763332605362, 'f1': 0.18744036555290222}"", ""{'precision': -0.07508712261915207, 'recall': 0.037153083831071854, 'f1': -0.017948396503925323}"", ""{'precision': 0.2166709154844284, 'recall': 0.17746104300022125, 'f1': 0.19829514622688293}"", ""{'precision': 0.07609530538320541, 'recall': 0.12819607555866241, 'f1': 0.10347115993499756}"", ""{'precision': 0.23566016554832458, 'recall': 0.2002030313014984, 'f1': 0.2191401720046997}"", ""{'precision': 0.039474498480558395, 'recall': 0.03034212253987789, 'f1': 0.03647209703922272}"", ""{'precision': 0.17368051409721375, 'recall': 0.15962590277194977, 'f1': 0.16799703240394592}"", ""{'precision': -0.06723884493112564, 'recall': 0.22073249518871307, 'f1': 0.07412375509738922}"", ""{'precision': 0.13290952146053314, 'recall': 0.07355167716741562, 'f1': 0.1045115739107132}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1231552158867506, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1595867466221573, 0.2816988029230364, 0.0375123027908174, 0.0, 0.121658365925153, 0.0026883850904072, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1601171066931316, 0.0, 0.118127981268613, 0.023413470249148, 0.1743353397675923, 0.017465844953817, 0.0, 0.1669695384489661, 0.1627683104536919, 0.0, 0.0606433872310888, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.1666666666666665, 3.8181818181818183, 1.105263157894737, 4.357142857142857, 8.142857142857142, 8.285714285714286, 6.2, 3.6666666666666665, 1.903225806451613, 1.0285714285714285, 2.5789473684210527, 4.0, 2.8666666666666667, 2.15, 5.8, 4.333333333333333, 2.3, 6.714285714285714, 1.5357142857142858, 2.869565217391304, 1.24, 2.0714285714285716, 3.111111111111111, 1.5454545454545454, 1.037037037037037, 4.714285714285714, 1.2666666666666666, 2.4545454545454546, 2.25, 3.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.10684812068939209, 'recall': 0.03631405159831047, 'f1': 0.07283965498209}"", ""{'precision': 0.18081633746623993, 'recall': 0.21930274367332458, 'f1': 0.20128819346427917}"", ""{'precision': 0.17166095972061157, 'recall': 0.13189461827278137, 'f1': 0.15307734906673431}"", ""{'precision': 0.2035761922597885, 'recall': 0.36162516474723816, 'f1': 0.28257477283477783}"", ""{'precision': -0.007911596447229385, 'recall': 0.07360721379518509, 'f1': 0.03408719226717949}"", ""{'precision': -0.029209056869149208, 'recall': -0.0254511758685112, 'f1': -0.025661807507276535}"", ""{'precision': -0.28529930114746094, 'recall': -0.1471974402666092, 'f1': -0.21527764201164246}"", ""{'precision': 0.06908895075321198, 'recall': 0.19120818376541138, 'f1': 0.1308295577764511}"", ""{'precision': 0.24328982830047607, 'recall': 0.3773156702518463, 'f1': 0.3105713427066803}"", ""{'precision': 0.37962114810943604, 'recall': 0.23239125311374664, 'f1': 0.30609819293022156}"", ""{'precision': 0.14460481703281403, 'recall': 0.2137676626443863, 'f1': 0.18028776347637177}"", ""{'precision': 0.054828621447086334, 'recall': 0.1578940600156784, 'f1': 0.10728989541530609}"", ""{'precision': 0.3231819272041321, 'recall': 0.42914193868637085, 'f1': 0.3766500651836395}"", ""{'precision': 0.06238151714205742, 'recall': 0.07595311105251312, 'f1': 0.07067088782787323}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.040648944675922394, 'recall': 0.0014439028454944491, 'f1': 0.02255857363343239}"", ""{'precision': 0.33503711223602295, 'recall': 0.3662688434123993, 'f1': 0.3516627848148346}"", ""{'precision': -0.0808199793100357, 'recall': 0.04339419677853584, 'f1': -0.017838211730122566}"", ""{'precision': 0.17228850722312927, 'recall': 0.16112887859344482, 'f1': 0.16805635392665863}"", ""{'precision': 0.16065724194049835, 'recall': 0.2842628061771393, 'f1': 0.22298717498779297}"", ""{'precision': 0.19424818456172943, 'recall': 0.25405827164649963, 'f1': 0.22524210810661316}"", ""{'precision': 0.20658765733242035, 'recall': 0.1472964882850647, 'f1': 0.17810629308223724}"", ""{'precision': 0.02119770273566246, 'recall': 0.08223419636487961, 'f1': 0.0530717670917511}"", ""{'precision': 0.3092431426048279, 'recall': 0.23614603281021118, 'f1': 0.273618221282959}"", ""{'precision': 0.15373331308364868, 'recall': 0.1726284623146057, 'f1': 0.16452297568321228}"", ""{'precision': 0.1746618002653122, 'recall': 0.22373667359352112, 'f1': 0.20038409531116486}"", ""{'precision': 0.08880196511745453, 'recall': 0.07461851090192795, 'f1': 0.08319153636693954}"", ""{'precision': 0.1476742923259735, 'recall': 0.07884303480386734, 'f1': 0.11446332186460495}"", ""{'precision': -0.23309831321239471, 'recall': 0.09990908950567245, 'f1': -0.07053916156291962}"", ""{'precision': 0.03019283153116703, 'recall': 0.08091480284929276, 'f1': 0.05696043372154236}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.01413928988305, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.232914392851028, 0.288552621816469, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0777051775670442, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1016052632718472, 0.0, 0.1037397015701301, 0.0456987312059718, 0.0722312220036983, 0.1387480518647602, 0.0, 0.1161288667856411, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0851336600337967, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[5.666666666666667, 2.636363636363636, 2.789473684210526, 3.928571428571429, 6.714285714285714, 6.142857142857143, 7.0, 4.25, 1.4838709677419355, 1.0285714285714285, 2.789473684210526, 3.4, 3.0, 4.9, 5.8, 6.111111111111111, 2.5, 5.142857142857143, 1.5357142857142858, 2.652173913043478, 1.64, 1.1428571428571428, 6.888888888888889, 1.8484848484848484, 3.0, 5.714285714285714, 1.1, 2.909090909090909, 5.125, 2.6818181818181817]","[""{'precision': -0.09311841428279877, 'recall': -0.01294065173715353, 'f1': -0.051645345985889435}"", ""{'precision': 0.2109493762254715, 'recall': 0.20667512714862823, 'f1': 0.21009676158428192}"", ""{'precision': -0.02898159623146057, 'recall': 0.15586157143115997, 'f1': 0.0632597804069519}"", ""{'precision': 0.25616416335105896, 'recall': 0.3921296298503876, 'f1': 0.32437044382095337}"", ""{'precision': -0.03161277994513512, 'recall': 0.057851266115903854, 'f1': 0.014321071095764637}"", ""{'precision': -0.03530910238623619, 'recall': 0.05106435716152191, 'f1': 0.009115110151469707}"", ""{'precision': -0.35257774591445923, 'recall': -0.09080387651920319, 'f1': -0.22332797944545746}"", ""{'precision': 0.01716284081339836, 'recall': 0.16772548854351044, 'f1': 0.09279683977365494}"", ""{'precision': 0.3477271497249603, 'recall': 0.3651588559150696, 'f1': 0.35747477412223816}"", ""{'precision': 0.4063907563686371, 'recall': 0.23384788632392883, 'f1': 0.3198058307170868}"", ""{'precision': 0.09873276203870773, 'recall': 0.18228335678577423, 'f1': 0.14156284928321838}"", ""{'precision': 0.09469754993915558, 'recall': 0.19298988580703735, 'f1': 0.14476250112056732}"", ""{'precision': 0.32154300808906555, 'recall': 0.36767488718032837, 'f1': 0.345574289560318}"", ""{'precision': -0.08242210745811462, 'recall': 0.07026062160730362, 'f1': -0.005622691474854946}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.0636489987373352, 'recall': 0.29298919439315796, 'f1': 0.17709165811538696}"", ""{'precision': 0.32472991943359375, 'recall': 0.4210628569126129, 'f1': 0.37348079681396484}"", ""{'precision': 0.011358527466654778, 'recall': 0.052887097001075745, 'f1': 0.03360971808433533}"", ""{'precision': 0.17086820304393768, 'recall': 0.14884509146213531, 'f1': 0.16119760274887085}"", ""{'precision': 0.18676285445690155, 'recall': 0.2741827070713043, 'f1': 0.23135605454444885}"", ""{'precision': 0.01473683025687933, 'recall': 0.23198658227920532, 'f1': 0.1224624440073967}"", ""{'precision': 0.31424480676651, 'recall': 0.09978776425123215, 'f1': 0.2060675323009491}"", ""{'precision': -0.09696684777736664, 'recall': 0.08984457701444626, 'f1': -0.0036923084408044815}"", ""{'precision': 0.2577022612094879, 'recall': 0.20712047815322876, 'f1': 0.23353365063667297}"", ""{'precision': 0.04533824324607849, 'recall': 0.1415725201368332, 'f1': 0.09447082877159119}"", ""{'precision': 0.15169040858745575, 'recall': 0.21877674758434296, 'f1': 0.18633955717086792}"", ""{'precision': 0.09471594542264938, 'recall': 0.08893232047557831, 'f1': 0.09329762309789658}"", ""{'precision': 0.13611166179180145, 'recall': 0.09732230752706528, 'f1': 0.11807652562856674}"", ""{'precision': -0.1604962795972824, 'recall': 0.15840131044387817, 'f1': -0.00455790851265192}"", ""{'precision': 0.08433659374713898, 'recall': 0.07663544267416, 'f1': 0.08197701722383499}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1035056673507767, 0.0671608869518552, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2584050114622343, 0.3223659397724296, 0.138290599624506, 0.0, 0.1969509557508073, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0986639785766601, 0.0, 0.0018812325738725, 0.0822918270022972, 0.0246503920127183, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0802679530882732, 0.1523317510883013, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0576822277357025]","[3.9166666666666665, 3.636363636363636, 0.4736842105263157, 3.4285714285714284, 10.0, 4.285714285714286, 3.8, 2.5833333333333335, 1.3548387096774193, 0.8857142857142857, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7333333333333334, 2.4, 5.35, 11.0, 4.888888888888889, 2.9, 2.7142857142857144, 1.9642857142857144, 2.260869565217391, 2.0, 2.2857142857142856, 4.333333333333333, 2.060606060606061, 0.925925925925926, 5.0, 1.7666666666666666, 4.2727272727272725, 8.875, 1.5454545454545454]","[""{'precision': 0.018605075776576996, 'recall': 0.027676809579133987, 'f1': 0.024723809212446213}"", ""{'precision': 0.11408830434083939, 'recall': 0.12945179641246796, 'f1': 0.12318607419729233}"", ""{'precision': -0.044818583875894547, 'recall': 0.039317525923252106, 'f1': -0.0014776296447962523}"", ""{'precision': 0.28842395544052124, 'recall': 0.400706022977829, 'f1': 0.3450360596179962}"", ""{'precision': -0.05558670684695244, 'recall': 0.05271483585238457, 'f1': -0.00039977935375645757}"", ""{'precision': 0.16830281913280487, 'recall': 0.07726295292377472, 'f1': 0.12379739433526993}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.017596537247300148, 'recall': 0.0009918430587276816, 'f1': 0.010889396071434021}"", ""{'precision': 0.3915248215198517, 'recall': 0.3192733824253082, 'f1': 0.35619881749153137}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.22101496160030365, 'recall': 0.1334792971611023, 'f1': 0.17820799350738525}"", ""{'precision': 0.1150352880358696, 'recall': 0.19117280840873718, 'f1': 0.1541975736618042}"", ""{'precision': 0.40110504627227783, 'recall': 0.40135687589645386, 'f1': 0.4022037982940674}"", ""{'precision': -0.0658365860581398, 'recall': 0.0735541507601738, 'f1': 0.004498577211052179}"", ""{'precision': -0.07433929294347763, 'recall': -0.10522875189781189, 'f1': -0.08806341141462326}"", ""{'precision': 0.06748929619789124, 'recall': 0.10652444511651993, 'f1': 0.08841516077518463}"", ""{'precision': 0.3841123580932617, 'recall': 0.2892446517944336, 'f1': 0.3373279571533203}"", ""{'precision': 0.03829863667488098, 'recall': 0.039665237069129944, 'f1': 0.04054334759712219}"", ""{'precision': 0.0621151439845562, 'recall': 0.06140831857919693, 'f1': 0.06328627467155457}"", ""{'precision': 0.2234218567609787, 'recall': 0.2235700637102127, 'f1': 0.22475756704807281}"", ""{'precision': 0.09432080388069153, 'recall': 0.19741639494895935, 'f1': 0.14673668146133423}"", ""{'precision': 0.17018228769302368, 'recall': 0.17701993882656097, 'f1': 0.17494195699691772}"", ""{'precision': -0.05711100995540619, 'recall': 0.15987704694271088, 'f1': 0.05057244002819061}"", ""{'precision': 0.1795092225074768, 'recall': 0.22820739448070526, 'f1': 0.20503807067871094}"", ""{'precision': 0.17392954230308533, 'recall': 0.1660403460264206, 'f1': 0.17133016884326935}"", ""{'precision': 0.24478335678577423, 'recall': 0.23942787945270538, 'f1': 0.2433353066444397}"", ""{'precision': 0.051276274025440216, 'recall': 0.03819303587079048, 'f1': 0.04627799242734909}"", ""{'precision': 0.0014669972006231546, 'recall': 0.09220745414495468, 'f1': 0.04797528684139252}"", ""{'precision': -0.14923645555973053, 'recall': 0.13711276650428772, 'f1': -0.008572653867304325}"", ""{'precision': 0.06578033417463303, 'recall': 0.1044427752494812, 'f1': 0.08652433007955551}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use (with examples): ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Format your answer as follows: (Teaching Method) (Response) Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.280274337093472, 0.0595901505578131, 0.0634508564975691, 0.0, 0.1072481046120325, 0.2331032305449905, 0.1887971609447683, 0.4482468976384072, 0.218167631398606, 0.2372445311148961, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1737546155282429, 0.1121535111154828, 0.1455629308592705, 0.2691694521503486, 0.0387265856899321, 0.1543118895803178, 0.1429861229229596, 0.2223921435844164, 0.1244109327523227, 0.0, 0.1376201412853196, 0.0359484198870081, 0.0885679996609688, 0.1497610494494438]","[2.4166666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 1.7142857142857142, 1.8571428571428572, 2.142857142857143, 2.4, 1.5833333333333333, 0.8064516129032258, 0.3714285714285714, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 3.0, 1.8888888888888888, 1.7, 2.4285714285714284, 1.1071428571428572, 0.9130434782608696, 0.56, 1.4285714285714286, 0.7777777777777778, 0.8181818181818182, 1.2592592592592593, 1.8571428571428572, 0.5333333333333333, 2.090909090909091, 1.875, 0.9090909090909092]","[""{'precision': 0.13864237070083618, 'recall': 0.22377946972846985, 'f1': 0.18218955397605896}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.29420068860054016, 'recall': 0.45664507150650024, 'f1': 0.37520068883895874}"", ""{'precision': 0.13351726531982422, 'recall': 0.29529616236686707, 'f1': 0.21441839635372162}"", ""{'precision': 0.29231661558151245, 'recall': 0.2771975100040436, 'f1': 0.28590792417526245}"", ""{'precision': -0.16725677251815796, 'recall': -0.02978040836751461, 'f1': -0.09770578891038895}"", ""{'precision': 0.218782439827919, 'recall': 0.24108827114105225, 'f1': 0.2311628758907318}"", ""{'precision': 0.24765720963478088, 'recall': 0.2681216597557068, 'f1': 0.25907573103904724}"", ""{'precision': 0.17579273879528046, 'recall': 0.0702231302857399, 'f1': 0.12388003617525101}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.08622314035892487, 'recall': 0.32667577266693115, 'f1': 0.2049374133348465}"", ""{'precision': 0.25753599405288696, 'recall': 0.3161171078681946, 'f1': 0.2878223955631256}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.13379955291748047, 'recall': 0.09721406549215317, 'f1': 0.11687683314085007}"", ""{'precision': 0.015880854800343513, 'recall': 0.0830654427409172, 'f1': 0.05079316720366478}"", ""{'precision': 0.23008720576763153, 'recall': 0.4026769995689392, 'f1': 0.31608065962791443}"", ""{'precision': 0.296329528093338, 'recall': 0.46848103404045105, 'f1': 0.38202130794525146}"", ""{'precision': 0.12538881599903107, 'recall': 0.12354177236557007, 'f1': 0.12588776648044586}"", ""{'precision': 0.3607337772846222, 'recall': 0.31556951999664307, 'f1': 0.33912941813468933}"", ""{'precision': -0.07983797043561935, 'recall': 0.057360295206308365, 'f1': -0.010546828620135784}"", ""{'precision': 0.31597214937210083, 'recall': 0.2876557409763336, 'f1': 0.3029094934463501}"", ""{'precision': 0.09233592450618744, 'recall': 0.2008637934923172, 'f1': 0.14741015434265137}"", ""{'precision': 0.22945044934749603, 'recall': 0.2754858434200287, 'f1': 0.2535819411277771}"", ""{'precision': 0.1828542798757553, 'recall': 0.2094971388578415, 'f1': 0.19744791090488434}"", ""{'precision': 0.10266786813735962, 'recall': 0.19699440896511078, 'f1': 0.1507779061794281}"", ""{'precision': 0.10981395095586777, 'recall': 0.047144029289484024, 'f1': 0.07977928966283798}"", ""{'precision': 0.09698135405778885, 'recall': 0.290243923664093, 'f1': 0.1931089609861374}"", ""{'precision': 0.07298797369003296, 'recall': 0.2475324124097824, 'f1': 0.16013599932193756}"", ""{'precision': 0.09527769684791565, 'recall': 0.10083868354558945, 'f1': 0.09952209889888763}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.0602024057870188, 0.0369230996710913, 0.0334222354874107, 0.0, 0.0172822121316674, 0.2822177794147447, 0.1264396151914723, 0.4482468976384072, 0.2166361496557471, 0.2112315144141515, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1458772459155634, 0.0484547153022719, 0.0976198112765639, 0.1287198804729226, 0.0252047787261781, 0.0963881797449929, 0.0319340280246817, 0.2765885904901324, 0.0176132574100486, 0.0, 0.1542999093435335, 0.2538067443387491, 0.0, 0.1461071665346364]","[2.1666666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 2.7142857142857144, 1.7142857142857142, 2.142857142857143, 1.4, 1.3333333333333333, 0.3870967741935484, 0.6285714285714286, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 4.8, 1.5555555555555556, 2.7, 2.142857142857143, 0.6071428571428571, 1.608695652173913, 1.2, 1.7857142857142858, 1.1111111111111112, 0.4545454545454545, 1.4074074074074074, 3.2857142857142856, 0.5333333333333333, 1.3636363636363635, 5.125, 0.8181818181818182]","[""{'precision': 0.11144650727510452, 'recall': 0.16678740084171295, 'f1': 0.1403663456439972}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.16733106970787048, 'recall': 0.34498879313468933, 'f1': 0.2558545470237732}"", ""{'precision': 0.14777971804141998, 'recall': 0.12287995219230652, 'f1': 0.13670334219932556}"", ""{'precision': 0.14047302305698395, 'recall': 0.16943396627902985, 'f1': 0.15628546476364136}"", ""{'precision': -0.1741969883441925, 'recall': -0.2152625024318695, 'f1': -0.19287870824337006}"", ""{'precision': 0.10095961391925812, 'recall': -0.010690257884562016, 'f1': 0.04605867713689804}"", ""{'precision': 0.4403025507926941, 'recall': 0.15784242749214172, 'f1': 0.29640036821365356}"", ""{'precision': 0.1082160696387291, 'recall': -0.02357855811715126, 'f1': 0.043000295758247375}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.0672667920589447, 'recall': 0.34117069840431213, 'f1': 0.20187444984912872}"", ""{'precision': 0.21142058074474335, 'recall': 0.2578919529914856, 'f1': 0.23579636216163635}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.07662168145179749, 'recall': -0.05927005410194397, 'f1': 0.00935102254152298}"", ""{'precision': -0.02370366081595421, 'recall': -0.02631603181362152, 'f1': -0.02334471233189106}"", ""{'precision': 0.3802837133407593, 'recall': 0.37594321370124817, 'f1': 0.37912291288375854}"", ""{'precision': 0.22057241201400757, 'recall': 0.2892892360687256, 'f1': 0.25591564178466797}"", ""{'precision': 0.13475148379802704, 'recall': -0.040554143488407135, 'f1': 0.047102976590394974}"", ""{'precision': 0.2246946543455124, 'recall': 0.10567621141672134, 'f1': 0.16584555804729462}"", ""{'precision': -0.022776130586862564, 'recall': 0.083047054708004, 'f1': 0.031150298193097115}"", ""{'precision': 0.2631351351737976, 'recall': 0.2743387222290039, 'f1': 0.269919216632843}"", ""{'precision': -0.08870362490415573, 'recall': 0.10129321366548538, 'f1': 0.006090278271585703}"", ""{'precision': 0.42749470472335815, 'recall': 0.1397526115179062, 'f1': 0.28082096576690674}"", ""{'precision': 0.06014829874038696, 'recall': 0.12220893800258636, 'f1': 0.09246557205915451}"", ""{'precision': 0.2430046945810318, 'recall': 0.3270018994808197, 'f1': 0.2858295142650604}"", ""{'precision': 0.14836622774600983, 'recall': 0.00877873133867979, 'f1': 0.07909627258777618}"", ""{'precision': 0.2596312463283539, 'recall': 0.2833509147167206, 'f1': 0.2726484537124634}"", ""{'precision': -0.04212549328804016, 'recall': 0.2262428104877472, 'f1': 0.0899641290307045}"", ""{'precision': 0.13963252305984497, 'recall': 0.06494591385126114, 'f1': 0.10346974432468414}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  Directly answer the student's question.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.1387281377207149, 0.0326287712524776, 0.0931273669314074, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3685939814893283, 0.3223659397724296, 0.2835382546816534, 0.0353186986044697, 0.2098288242723427, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1303345371663271, 0.1411195762450153, 0.2307743706703186, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1447803716874165, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0144460941817118, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.0833333333333335, 1.6363636363636365, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7857142857142856, 5.142857142857143, 8.285714285714286, 3.8, 3.6666666666666665, 0.7741935483870968, 0.8857142857142857, 1.2105263157894737, 2.0, 2.3333333333333335, 2.75, 6.8, 6.888888888888889, 3.7, 5.571428571428571, 0.9642857142857144, 1.6521739130434785, 0.92, 3.2857142857142856, 5.111111111111111, 1.4848484848484849, 2.2222222222222223, 4.571428571428571, 1.3666666666666667, 2.727272727272727, 8.75, 2.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.11432495713233948, 'recall': 0.03324726223945618, 'f1': 0.07496145367622375}"", ""{'precision': 0.34705960750579834, 'recall': 0.16323672235012054, 'f1': 0.2547290027141571}"", ""{'precision': -0.04055697098374367, 'recall': 0.13544459640979767, 'f1': 0.047443777322769165}"", ""{'precision': 0.2874433696269989, 'recall': 0.3909418284893036, 'f1': 0.33976122736930847}"", ""{'precision': 0.013704590499401093, 'recall': 0.1261105239391327, 'f1': 0.07079096138477325}"", ""{'precision': 0.0022958312183618546, 'recall': 0.0070695350877940655, 'f1': 0.006298996973782778}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.04759303852915764, 'recall': 0.14297078549861908, 'f1': 0.09630267322063446}"", ""{'precision': 0.5061132907867432, 'recall': 0.3179398477077484, 'f1': 0.4113249182701111}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.3297567069530487, 'recall': 0.20683324337005615, 'f1': 0.268756240606308}"", ""{'precision': 0.0749378353357315, 'recall': 0.11573436856269836, 'f1': 0.09672435373067856}"", ""{'precision': 0.4073179364204407, 'recall': 0.39869120717048645, 'f1': 0.4039713740348816}"", ""{'precision': -0.009095241315662861, 'recall': 0.020507877692580223, 'f1': 0.007277961820363998}"", ""{'precision': -0.06473217904567719, 'recall': -0.034142181277275085, 'f1': -0.047779280692338943}"", ""{'precision': -0.04261331260204315, 'recall': 0.1446707844734192, 'f1': 0.050818946212530136}"", ""{'precision': 0.3305618166923523, 'recall': 0.26773256063461304, 'f1': 0.30009621381759644}"", ""{'precision': -0.031261153519153595, 'recall': 0.018836529925465584, 'f1': -0.004703410901129246}"", ""{'precision': 0.15156836807727814, 'recall': 0.07251915335655212, 'f1': 0.11317533999681473}"", ""{'precision': 0.22911085188388824, 'recall': 0.17426548898220062, 'f1': 0.20283786952495575}"", ""{'precision': 0.24250556528568268, 'recall': 0.2621985375881195, 'f1': 0.2535487413406372}"", ""{'precision': 0.19026708602905273, 'recall': 0.1819763332605362, 'f1': 0.18744036555290222}"", ""{'precision': -0.07508712261915207, 'recall': 0.037153083831071854, 'f1': -0.017948396503925323}"", ""{'precision': 0.2166709154844284, 'recall': 0.17746104300022125, 'f1': 0.19829514622688293}"", ""{'precision': 0.07609530538320541, 'recall': 0.12819607555866241, 'f1': 0.10347115993499756}"", ""{'precision': 0.23566016554832458, 'recall': 0.2002030313014984, 'f1': 0.2191401720046997}"", ""{'precision': 0.039474498480558395, 'recall': 0.03034212253987789, 'f1': 0.03647209703922272}"", ""{'precision': 0.17368051409721375, 'recall': 0.15962590277194977, 'f1': 0.16799703240394592}"", ""{'precision': -0.06723884493112564, 'recall': 0.22073249518871307, 'f1': 0.07412375509738922}"", ""{'precision': 0.13290952146053314, 'recall': 0.07355167716741562, 'f1': 0.1045115739107132}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1231552158867506, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1595867466221573, 0.2816988029230364, 0.0375123027908174, 0.0, 0.121658365925153, 0.0026883850904072, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1601171066931316, 0.0, 0.118127981268613, 0.023413470249148, 0.1743353397675923, 0.017465844953817, 0.0, 0.1669695384489661, 0.1627683104536919, 0.0, 0.0606433872310888, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.1666666666666665, 3.8181818181818183, 1.105263157894737, 4.357142857142857, 8.142857142857142, 8.285714285714286, 6.2, 3.6666666666666665, 1.903225806451613, 1.0285714285714285, 2.5789473684210527, 4.0, 2.8666666666666667, 2.15, 5.8, 4.333333333333333, 2.3, 6.714285714285714, 1.5357142857142858, 2.869565217391304, 1.24, 2.0714285714285716, 3.111111111111111, 1.5454545454545454, 1.037037037037037, 4.714285714285714, 1.2666666666666666, 2.4545454545454546, 2.25, 3.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.10684812068939209, 'recall': 0.03631405159831047, 'f1': 0.07283965498209}"", ""{'precision': 0.18081633746623993, 'recall': 0.21930274367332458, 'f1': 0.20128819346427917}"", ""{'precision': 0.17166095972061157, 'recall': 0.13189461827278137, 'f1': 0.15307734906673431}"", ""{'precision': 0.2035761922597885, 'recall': 0.36162516474723816, 'f1': 0.28257477283477783}"", ""{'precision': -0.007911596447229385, 'recall': 0.07360721379518509, 'f1': 0.03408719226717949}"", ""{'precision': -0.029209056869149208, 'recall': -0.0254511758685112, 'f1': -0.025661807507276535}"", ""{'precision': -0.28529930114746094, 'recall': -0.1471974402666092, 'f1': -0.21527764201164246}"", ""{'precision': 0.06908895075321198, 'recall': 0.19120818376541138, 'f1': 0.1308295577764511}"", ""{'precision': 0.24328982830047607, 'recall': 0.3773156702518463, 'f1': 0.3105713427066803}"", ""{'precision': 0.37962114810943604, 'recall': 0.23239125311374664, 'f1': 0.30609819293022156}"", ""{'precision': 0.14460481703281403, 'recall': 0.2137676626443863, 'f1': 0.18028776347637177}"", ""{'precision': 0.054828621447086334, 'recall': 0.1578940600156784, 'f1': 0.10728989541530609}"", ""{'precision': 0.3231819272041321, 'recall': 0.42914193868637085, 'f1': 0.3766500651836395}"", ""{'precision': 0.06238151714205742, 'recall': 0.07595311105251312, 'f1': 0.07067088782787323}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.040648944675922394, 'recall': 0.0014439028454944491, 'f1': 0.02255857363343239}"", ""{'precision': 0.33503711223602295, 'recall': 0.3662688434123993, 'f1': 0.3516627848148346}"", ""{'precision': -0.0808199793100357, 'recall': 0.04339419677853584, 'f1': -0.017838211730122566}"", ""{'precision': 0.17228850722312927, 'recall': 0.16112887859344482, 'f1': 0.16805635392665863}"", ""{'precision': 0.16065724194049835, 'recall': 0.2842628061771393, 'f1': 0.22298717498779297}"", ""{'precision': 0.19424818456172943, 'recall': 0.25405827164649963, 'f1': 0.22524210810661316}"", ""{'precision': 0.20658765733242035, 'recall': 0.1472964882850647, 'f1': 0.17810629308223724}"", ""{'precision': 0.02119770273566246, 'recall': 0.08223419636487961, 'f1': 0.0530717670917511}"", ""{'precision': 0.3092431426048279, 'recall': 0.23614603281021118, 'f1': 0.273618221282959}"", ""{'precision': 0.15373331308364868, 'recall': 0.1726284623146057, 'f1': 0.16452297568321228}"", ""{'precision': 0.1746618002653122, 'recall': 0.22373667359352112, 'f1': 0.20038409531116486}"", ""{'precision': 0.08880196511745453, 'recall': 0.07461851090192795, 'f1': 0.08319153636693954}"", ""{'precision': 0.1476742923259735, 'recall': 0.07884303480386734, 'f1': 0.11446332186460495}"", ""{'precision': -0.23309831321239471, 'recall': 0.09990908950567245, 'f1': -0.07053916156291962}"", ""{'precision': 0.03019283153116703, 'recall': 0.08091480284929276, 'f1': 0.05696043372154236}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.01413928988305, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.232914392851028, 0.288552621816469, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0777051775670442, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1016052632718472, 0.0, 0.1037397015701301, 0.0456987312059718, 0.0722312220036983, 0.1387480518647602, 0.0, 0.1161288667856411, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0851336600337967, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[5.666666666666667, 2.636363636363636, 2.789473684210526, 3.928571428571429, 6.714285714285714, 6.142857142857143, 7.0, 4.25, 1.4838709677419355, 1.0285714285714285, 2.789473684210526, 3.4, 3.0, 4.9, 5.8, 6.111111111111111, 2.5, 5.142857142857143, 1.5357142857142858, 2.652173913043478, 1.64, 1.1428571428571428, 6.888888888888889, 1.8484848484848484, 3.0, 5.714285714285714, 1.1, 2.909090909090909, 5.125, 2.6818181818181817]","[""{'precision': -0.09311841428279877, 'recall': -0.01294065173715353, 'f1': -0.051645345985889435}"", ""{'precision': 0.2109493762254715, 'recall': 0.20667512714862823, 'f1': 0.21009676158428192}"", ""{'precision': -0.02898159623146057, 'recall': 0.15586157143115997, 'f1': 0.0632597804069519}"", ""{'precision': 0.25616416335105896, 'recall': 0.3921296298503876, 'f1': 0.32437044382095337}"", ""{'precision': -0.03161277994513512, 'recall': 0.057851266115903854, 'f1': 0.014321071095764637}"", ""{'precision': -0.03530910238623619, 'recall': 0.05106435716152191, 'f1': 0.009115110151469707}"", ""{'precision': -0.35257774591445923, 'recall': -0.09080387651920319, 'f1': -0.22332797944545746}"", ""{'precision': 0.01716284081339836, 'recall': 0.16772548854351044, 'f1': 0.09279683977365494}"", ""{'precision': 0.3477271497249603, 'recall': 0.3651588559150696, 'f1': 0.35747477412223816}"", ""{'precision': 0.4063907563686371, 'recall': 0.23384788632392883, 'f1': 0.3198058307170868}"", ""{'precision': 0.09873276203870773, 'recall': 0.18228335678577423, 'f1': 0.14156284928321838}"", ""{'precision': 0.09469754993915558, 'recall': 0.19298988580703735, 'f1': 0.14476250112056732}"", ""{'precision': 0.32154300808906555, 'recall': 0.36767488718032837, 'f1': 0.345574289560318}"", ""{'precision': -0.08242210745811462, 'recall': 0.07026062160730362, 'f1': -0.005622691474854946}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.0636489987373352, 'recall': 0.29298919439315796, 'f1': 0.17709165811538696}"", ""{'precision': 0.32472991943359375, 'recall': 0.4210628569126129, 'f1': 0.37348079681396484}"", ""{'precision': 0.011358527466654778, 'recall': 0.052887097001075745, 'f1': 0.03360971808433533}"", ""{'precision': 0.17086820304393768, 'recall': 0.14884509146213531, 'f1': 0.16119760274887085}"", ""{'precision': 0.18676285445690155, 'recall': 0.2741827070713043, 'f1': 0.23135605454444885}"", ""{'precision': 0.01473683025687933, 'recall': 0.23198658227920532, 'f1': 0.1224624440073967}"", ""{'precision': 0.31424480676651, 'recall': 0.09978776425123215, 'f1': 0.2060675323009491}"", ""{'precision': -0.09696684777736664, 'recall': 0.08984457701444626, 'f1': -0.0036923084408044815}"", ""{'precision': 0.2577022612094879, 'recall': 0.20712047815322876, 'f1': 0.23353365063667297}"", ""{'precision': 0.04533824324607849, 'recall': 0.1415725201368332, 'f1': 0.09447082877159119}"", ""{'precision': 0.15169040858745575, 'recall': 0.21877674758434296, 'f1': 0.18633955717086792}"", ""{'precision': 0.09471594542264938, 'recall': 0.08893232047557831, 'f1': 0.09329762309789658}"", ""{'precision': 0.13611166179180145, 'recall': 0.09732230752706528, 'f1': 0.11807652562856674}"", ""{'precision': -0.1604962795972824, 'recall': 0.15840131044387817, 'f1': -0.00455790851265192}"", ""{'precision': 0.08433659374713898, 'recall': 0.07663544267416, 'f1': 0.08197701722383499}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1035056673507767, 0.0671608869518552, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2584050114622343, 0.3223659397724296, 0.138290599624506, 0.0, 0.1969509557508073, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0986639785766601, 0.0, 0.0018812325738725, 0.0822918270022972, 0.0246503920127183, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0802679530882732, 0.1523317510883013, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0576822277357025]","[3.9166666666666665, 3.636363636363636, 0.4736842105263157, 3.4285714285714284, 10.0, 4.285714285714286, 3.8, 2.5833333333333335, 1.3548387096774193, 0.8857142857142857, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7333333333333334, 2.4, 5.35, 11.0, 4.888888888888889, 2.9, 2.7142857142857144, 1.9642857142857144, 2.260869565217391, 2.0, 2.2857142857142856, 4.333333333333333, 2.060606060606061, 0.925925925925926, 5.0, 1.7666666666666666, 4.2727272727272725, 8.875, 1.5454545454545454]","[""{'precision': 0.018605075776576996, 'recall': 0.027676809579133987, 'f1': 0.024723809212446213}"", ""{'precision': 0.11408830434083939, 'recall': 0.12945179641246796, 'f1': 0.12318607419729233}"", ""{'precision': -0.044818583875894547, 'recall': 0.039317525923252106, 'f1': -0.0014776296447962523}"", ""{'precision': 0.28842395544052124, 'recall': 0.400706022977829, 'f1': 0.3450360596179962}"", ""{'precision': -0.05558670684695244, 'recall': 0.05271483585238457, 'f1': -0.00039977935375645757}"", ""{'precision': 0.16830281913280487, 'recall': 0.07726295292377472, 'f1': 0.12379739433526993}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.017596537247300148, 'recall': 0.0009918430587276816, 'f1': 0.010889396071434021}"", ""{'precision': 0.3915248215198517, 'recall': 0.3192733824253082, 'f1': 0.35619881749153137}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.22101496160030365, 'recall': 0.1334792971611023, 'f1': 0.17820799350738525}"", ""{'precision': 0.1150352880358696, 'recall': 0.19117280840873718, 'f1': 0.1541975736618042}"", ""{'precision': 0.40110504627227783, 'recall': 0.40135687589645386, 'f1': 0.4022037982940674}"", ""{'precision': -0.0658365860581398, 'recall': 0.0735541507601738, 'f1': 0.004498577211052179}"", ""{'precision': -0.07433929294347763, 'recall': -0.10522875189781189, 'f1': -0.08806341141462326}"", ""{'precision': 0.06748929619789124, 'recall': 0.10652444511651993, 'f1': 0.08841516077518463}"", ""{'precision': 0.3841123580932617, 'recall': 0.2892446517944336, 'f1': 0.3373279571533203}"", ""{'precision': 0.03829863667488098, 'recall': 0.039665237069129944, 'f1': 0.04054334759712219}"", ""{'precision': 0.0621151439845562, 'recall': 0.06140831857919693, 'f1': 0.06328627467155457}"", ""{'precision': 0.2234218567609787, 'recall': 0.2235700637102127, 'f1': 0.22475756704807281}"", ""{'precision': 0.09432080388069153, 'recall': 0.19741639494895935, 'f1': 0.14673668146133423}"", ""{'precision': 0.17018228769302368, 'recall': 0.17701993882656097, 'f1': 0.17494195699691772}"", ""{'precision': -0.05711100995540619, 'recall': 0.15987704694271088, 'f1': 0.05057244002819061}"", ""{'precision': 0.1795092225074768, 'recall': 0.22820739448070526, 'f1': 0.20503807067871094}"", ""{'precision': 0.17392954230308533, 'recall': 0.1660403460264206, 'f1': 0.17133016884326935}"", ""{'precision': 0.24478335678577423, 'recall': 0.23942787945270538, 'f1': 0.2433353066444397}"", ""{'precision': 0.051276274025440216, 'recall': 0.03819303587079048, 'f1': 0.04627799242734909}"", ""{'precision': 0.0014669972006231546, 'recall': 0.09220745414495468, 'f1': 0.04797528684139252}"", ""{'precision': -0.14923645555973053, 'recall': 0.13711276650428772, 'f1': -0.008572653867304325}"", ""{'precision': 0.06578033417463303, 'recall': 0.1044427752494812, 'f1': 0.08652433007955551}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use (with examples): ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Format your answer as follows: (Teaching Method) (Response) Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.280274337093472, 0.0595901505578131, 0.0634508564975691, 0.0, 0.1072481046120325, 0.2331032305449905, 0.1887971609447683, 0.4482468976384072, 0.218167631398606, 0.2372445311148961, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1737546155282429, 0.1121535111154828, 0.1455629308592705, 0.2691694521503486, 0.0387265856899321, 0.1543118895803178, 0.1429861229229596, 0.2223921435844164, 0.1244109327523227, 0.0, 0.1376201412853196, 0.0359484198870081, 0.0885679996609688, 0.1497610494494438]","[2.4166666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 1.7142857142857142, 1.8571428571428572, 2.142857142857143, 2.4, 1.5833333333333333, 0.8064516129032258, 0.3714285714285714, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 3.0, 1.8888888888888888, 1.7, 2.4285714285714284, 1.1071428571428572, 0.9130434782608696, 0.56, 1.4285714285714286, 0.7777777777777778, 0.8181818181818182, 1.2592592592592593, 1.8571428571428572, 0.5333333333333333, 2.090909090909091, 1.875, 0.9090909090909092]","[""{'precision': 0.13864237070083618, 'recall': 0.22377946972846985, 'f1': 0.18218955397605896}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.29420068860054016, 'recall': 0.45664507150650024, 'f1': 0.37520068883895874}"", ""{'precision': 0.13351726531982422, 'recall': 0.29529616236686707, 'f1': 0.21441839635372162}"", ""{'precision': 0.29231661558151245, 'recall': 0.2771975100040436, 'f1': 0.28590792417526245}"", ""{'precision': -0.16725677251815796, 'recall': -0.02978040836751461, 'f1': -0.09770578891038895}"", ""{'precision': 0.218782439827919, 'recall': 0.24108827114105225, 'f1': 0.2311628758907318}"", ""{'precision': 0.24765720963478088, 'recall': 0.2681216597557068, 'f1': 0.25907573103904724}"", ""{'precision': 0.17579273879528046, 'recall': 0.0702231302857399, 'f1': 0.12388003617525101}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.08622314035892487, 'recall': 0.32667577266693115, 'f1': 0.2049374133348465}"", ""{'precision': 0.25753599405288696, 'recall': 0.3161171078681946, 'f1': 0.2878223955631256}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.13379955291748047, 'recall': 0.09721406549215317, 'f1': 0.11687683314085007}"", ""{'precision': 0.015880854800343513, 'recall': 0.0830654427409172, 'f1': 0.05079316720366478}"", ""{'precision': 0.23008720576763153, 'recall': 0.4026769995689392, 'f1': 0.31608065962791443}"", ""{'precision': 0.296329528093338, 'recall': 0.46848103404045105, 'f1': 0.38202130794525146}"", ""{'precision': 0.12538881599903107, 'recall': 0.12354177236557007, 'f1': 0.12588776648044586}"", ""{'precision': 0.3607337772846222, 'recall': 0.31556951999664307, 'f1': 0.33912941813468933}"", ""{'precision': -0.07983797043561935, 'recall': 0.057360295206308365, 'f1': -0.010546828620135784}"", ""{'precision': 0.31597214937210083, 'recall': 0.2876557409763336, 'f1': 0.3029094934463501}"", ""{'precision': 0.09233592450618744, 'recall': 0.2008637934923172, 'f1': 0.14741015434265137}"", ""{'precision': 0.22945044934749603, 'recall': 0.2754858434200287, 'f1': 0.2535819411277771}"", ""{'precision': 0.1828542798757553, 'recall': 0.2094971388578415, 'f1': 0.19744791090488434}"", ""{'precision': 0.10266786813735962, 'recall': 0.19699440896511078, 'f1': 0.1507779061794281}"", ""{'precision': 0.10981395095586777, 'recall': 0.047144029289484024, 'f1': 0.07977928966283798}"", ""{'precision': 0.09698135405778885, 'recall': 0.290243923664093, 'f1': 0.1931089609861374}"", ""{'precision': 0.07298797369003296, 'recall': 0.2475324124097824, 'f1': 0.16013599932193756}"", ""{'precision': 0.09527769684791565, 'recall': 0.10083868354558945, 'f1': 0.09952209889888763}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.0602024057870188, 0.0369230996710913, 0.0334222354874107, 0.0, 0.0172822121316674, 0.2822177794147447, 0.1264396151914723, 0.4482468976384072, 0.2166361496557471, 0.2112315144141515, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1458772459155634, 0.0484547153022719, 0.0976198112765639, 0.1287198804729226, 0.0252047787261781, 0.0963881797449929, 0.0319340280246817, 0.2765885904901324, 0.0176132574100486, 0.0, 0.1542999093435335, 0.2538067443387491, 0.0, 0.1461071665346364]","[2.1666666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 2.7142857142857144, 1.7142857142857142, 2.142857142857143, 1.4, 1.3333333333333333, 0.3870967741935484, 0.6285714285714286, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 4.8, 1.5555555555555556, 2.7, 2.142857142857143, 0.6071428571428571, 1.608695652173913, 1.2, 1.7857142857142858, 1.1111111111111112, 0.4545454545454545, 1.4074074074074074, 3.2857142857142856, 0.5333333333333333, 1.3636363636363635, 5.125, 0.8181818181818182]","[""{'precision': 0.11144650727510452, 'recall': 0.16678740084171295, 'f1': 0.1403663456439972}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.16733106970787048, 'recall': 0.34498879313468933, 'f1': 0.2558545470237732}"", ""{'precision': 0.14777971804141998, 'recall': 0.12287995219230652, 'f1': 0.13670334219932556}"", ""{'precision': 0.14047302305698395, 'recall': 0.16943396627902985, 'f1': 0.15628546476364136}"", ""{'precision': -0.1741969883441925, 'recall': -0.2152625024318695, 'f1': -0.19287870824337006}"", ""{'precision': 0.10095961391925812, 'recall': -0.010690257884562016, 'f1': 0.04605867713689804}"", ""{'precision': 0.4403025507926941, 'recall': 0.15784242749214172, 'f1': 0.29640036821365356}"", ""{'precision': 0.1082160696387291, 'recall': -0.02357855811715126, 'f1': 0.043000295758247375}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.0672667920589447, 'recall': 0.34117069840431213, 'f1': 0.20187444984912872}"", ""{'precision': 0.21142058074474335, 'recall': 0.2578919529914856, 'f1': 0.23579636216163635}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.07662168145179749, 'recall': -0.05927005410194397, 'f1': 0.00935102254152298}"", ""{'precision': -0.02370366081595421, 'recall': -0.02631603181362152, 'f1': -0.02334471233189106}"", ""{'precision': 0.3802837133407593, 'recall': 0.37594321370124817, 'f1': 0.37912291288375854}"", ""{'precision': 0.22057241201400757, 'recall': 0.2892892360687256, 'f1': 0.25591564178466797}"", ""{'precision': 0.13475148379802704, 'recall': -0.040554143488407135, 'f1': 0.047102976590394974}"", ""{'precision': 0.2246946543455124, 'recall': 0.10567621141672134, 'f1': 0.16584555804729462}"", ""{'precision': -0.022776130586862564, 'recall': 0.083047054708004, 'f1': 0.031150298193097115}"", ""{'precision': 0.2631351351737976, 'recall': 0.2743387222290039, 'f1': 0.269919216632843}"", ""{'precision': -0.08870362490415573, 'recall': 0.10129321366548538, 'f1': 0.006090278271585703}"", ""{'precision': 0.42749470472335815, 'recall': 0.1397526115179062, 'f1': 0.28082096576690674}"", ""{'precision': 0.06014829874038696, 'recall': 0.12220893800258636, 'f1': 0.09246557205915451}"", ""{'precision': 0.2430046945810318, 'recall': 0.3270018994808197, 'f1': 0.2858295142650604}"", ""{'precision': 0.14836622774600983, 'recall': 0.00877873133867979, 'f1': 0.07909627258777618}"", ""{'precision': 0.2596312463283539, 'recall': 0.2833509147167206, 'f1': 0.2726484537124634}"", ""{'precision': -0.04212549328804016, 'recall': 0.2262428104877472, 'f1': 0.0899641290307045}"", ""{'precision': 0.13963252305984497, 'recall': 0.06494591385126114, 'f1': 0.10346974432468414}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  Directly answer the student's question.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.1387281377207149, 0.0326287712524776, 0.0931273669314074, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3685939814893283, 0.3223659397724296, 0.2835382546816534, 0.0353186986044697, 0.2098288242723427, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1303345371663271, 0.1411195762450153, 0.2307743706703186, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1447803716874165, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0144460941817118, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.0833333333333335, 1.6363636363636365, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7857142857142856, 5.142857142857143, 8.285714285714286, 3.8, 3.6666666666666665, 0.7741935483870968, 0.8857142857142857, 1.2105263157894737, 2.0, 2.3333333333333335, 2.75, 6.8, 6.888888888888889, 3.7, 5.571428571428571, 0.9642857142857144, 1.6521739130434785, 0.92, 3.2857142857142856, 5.111111111111111, 1.4848484848484849, 2.2222222222222223, 4.571428571428571, 1.3666666666666667, 2.727272727272727, 8.75, 2.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.11432495713233948, 'recall': 0.03324726223945618, 'f1': 0.07496145367622375}"", ""{'precision': 0.34705960750579834, 'recall': 0.16323672235012054, 'f1': 0.2547290027141571}"", ""{'precision': -0.04055697098374367, 'recall': 0.13544459640979767, 'f1': 0.047443777322769165}"", ""{'precision': 0.2874433696269989, 'recall': 0.3909418284893036, 'f1': 0.33976122736930847}"", ""{'precision': 0.013704590499401093, 'recall': 0.1261105239391327, 'f1': 0.07079096138477325}"", ""{'precision': 0.0022958312183618546, 'recall': 0.0070695350877940655, 'f1': 0.006298996973782778}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.04759303852915764, 'recall': 0.14297078549861908, 'f1': 0.09630267322063446}"", ""{'precision': 0.5061132907867432, 'recall': 0.3179398477077484, 'f1': 0.4113249182701111}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.3297567069530487, 'recall': 0.20683324337005615, 'f1': 0.268756240606308}"", ""{'precision': 0.0749378353357315, 'recall': 0.11573436856269836, 'f1': 0.09672435373067856}"", ""{'precision': 0.4073179364204407, 'recall': 0.39869120717048645, 'f1': 0.4039713740348816}"", ""{'precision': -0.009095241315662861, 'recall': 0.020507877692580223, 'f1': 0.007277961820363998}"", ""{'precision': -0.06473217904567719, 'recall': -0.034142181277275085, 'f1': -0.047779280692338943}"", ""{'precision': -0.04261331260204315, 'recall': 0.1446707844734192, 'f1': 0.050818946212530136}"", ""{'precision': 0.3305618166923523, 'recall': 0.26773256063461304, 'f1': 0.30009621381759644}"", ""{'precision': -0.031261153519153595, 'recall': 0.018836529925465584, 'f1': -0.004703410901129246}"", ""{'precision': 0.15156836807727814, 'recall': 0.07251915335655212, 'f1': 0.11317533999681473}"", ""{'precision': 0.22911085188388824, 'recall': 0.17426548898220062, 'f1': 0.20283786952495575}"", ""{'precision': 0.24250556528568268, 'recall': 0.2621985375881195, 'f1': 0.2535487413406372}"", ""{'precision': 0.19026708602905273, 'recall': 0.1819763332605362, 'f1': 0.18744036555290222}"", ""{'precision': -0.07508712261915207, 'recall': 0.037153083831071854, 'f1': -0.017948396503925323}"", ""{'precision': 0.2166709154844284, 'recall': 0.17746104300022125, 'f1': 0.19829514622688293}"", ""{'precision': 0.07609530538320541, 'recall': 0.12819607555866241, 'f1': 0.10347115993499756}"", ""{'precision': 0.23566016554832458, 'recall': 0.2002030313014984, 'f1': 0.2191401720046997}"", ""{'precision': 0.039474498480558395, 'recall': 0.03034212253987789, 'f1': 0.03647209703922272}"", ""{'precision': 0.17368051409721375, 'recall': 0.15962590277194977, 'f1': 0.16799703240394592}"", ""{'precision': -0.06723884493112564, 'recall': 0.22073249518871307, 'f1': 0.07412375509738922}"", ""{'precision': 0.13290952146053314, 'recall': 0.07355167716741562, 'f1': 0.1045115739107132}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1231552158867506, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1595867466221573, 0.2816988029230364, 0.0375123027908174, 0.0, 0.121658365925153, 0.0026883850904072, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1601171066931316, 0.0, 0.118127981268613, 0.023413470249148, 0.1743353397675923, 0.017465844953817, 0.0, 0.1669695384489661, 0.1627683104536919, 0.0, 0.0606433872310888, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.1666666666666665, 3.8181818181818183, 1.105263157894737, 4.357142857142857, 8.142857142857142, 8.285714285714286, 6.2, 3.6666666666666665, 1.903225806451613, 1.0285714285714285, 2.5789473684210527, 4.0, 2.8666666666666667, 2.15, 5.8, 4.333333333333333, 2.3, 6.714285714285714, 1.5357142857142858, 2.869565217391304, 1.24, 2.0714285714285716, 3.111111111111111, 1.5454545454545454, 1.037037037037037, 4.714285714285714, 1.2666666666666666, 2.4545454545454546, 2.25, 3.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.10684812068939209, 'recall': 0.03631405159831047, 'f1': 0.07283965498209}"", ""{'precision': 0.18081633746623993, 'recall': 0.21930274367332458, 'f1': 0.20128819346427917}"", ""{'precision': 0.17166095972061157, 'recall': 0.13189461827278137, 'f1': 0.15307734906673431}"", ""{'precision': 0.2035761922597885, 'recall': 0.36162516474723816, 'f1': 0.28257477283477783}"", ""{'precision': -0.007911596447229385, 'recall': 0.07360721379518509, 'f1': 0.03408719226717949}"", ""{'precision': -0.029209056869149208, 'recall': -0.0254511758685112, 'f1': -0.025661807507276535}"", ""{'precision': -0.28529930114746094, 'recall': -0.1471974402666092, 'f1': -0.21527764201164246}"", ""{'precision': 0.06908895075321198, 'recall': 0.19120818376541138, 'f1': 0.1308295577764511}"", ""{'precision': 0.24328982830047607, 'recall': 0.3773156702518463, 'f1': 0.3105713427066803}"", ""{'precision': 0.37962114810943604, 'recall': 0.23239125311374664, 'f1': 0.30609819293022156}"", ""{'precision': 0.14460481703281403, 'recall': 0.2137676626443863, 'f1': 0.18028776347637177}"", ""{'precision': 0.054828621447086334, 'recall': 0.1578940600156784, 'f1': 0.10728989541530609}"", ""{'precision': 0.3231819272041321, 'recall': 0.42914193868637085, 'f1': 0.3766500651836395}"", ""{'precision': 0.06238151714205742, 'recall': 0.07595311105251312, 'f1': 0.07067088782787323}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.040648944675922394, 'recall': 0.0014439028454944491, 'f1': 0.02255857363343239}"", ""{'precision': 0.33503711223602295, 'recall': 0.3662688434123993, 'f1': 0.3516627848148346}"", ""{'precision': -0.0808199793100357, 'recall': 0.04339419677853584, 'f1': -0.017838211730122566}"", ""{'precision': 0.17228850722312927, 'recall': 0.16112887859344482, 'f1': 0.16805635392665863}"", ""{'precision': 0.16065724194049835, 'recall': 0.2842628061771393, 'f1': 0.22298717498779297}"", ""{'precision': 0.19424818456172943, 'recall': 0.25405827164649963, 'f1': 0.22524210810661316}"", ""{'precision': 0.20658765733242035, 'recall': 0.1472964882850647, 'f1': 0.17810629308223724}"", ""{'precision': 0.02119770273566246, 'recall': 0.08223419636487961, 'f1': 0.0530717670917511}"", ""{'precision': 0.3092431426048279, 'recall': 0.23614603281021118, 'f1': 0.273618221282959}"", ""{'precision': 0.15373331308364868, 'recall': 0.1726284623146057, 'f1': 0.16452297568321228}"", ""{'precision': 0.1746618002653122, 'recall': 0.22373667359352112, 'f1': 0.20038409531116486}"", ""{'precision': 0.08880196511745453, 'recall': 0.07461851090192795, 'f1': 0.08319153636693954}"", ""{'precision': 0.1476742923259735, 'recall': 0.07884303480386734, 'f1': 0.11446332186460495}"", ""{'precision': -0.23309831321239471, 'recall': 0.09990908950567245, 'f1': -0.07053916156291962}"", ""{'precision': 0.03019283153116703, 'recall': 0.08091480284929276, 'f1': 0.05696043372154236}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.01413928988305, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.232914392851028, 0.288552621816469, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0777051775670442, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1016052632718472, 0.0, 0.1037397015701301, 0.0456987312059718, 0.0722312220036983, 0.1387480518647602, 0.0, 0.1161288667856411, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0851336600337967, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[5.666666666666667, 2.636363636363636, 2.789473684210526, 3.928571428571429, 6.714285714285714, 6.142857142857143, 7.0, 4.25, 1.4838709677419355, 1.0285714285714285, 2.789473684210526, 3.4, 3.0, 4.9, 5.8, 6.111111111111111, 2.5, 5.142857142857143, 1.5357142857142858, 2.652173913043478, 1.64, 1.1428571428571428, 6.888888888888889, 1.8484848484848484, 3.0, 5.714285714285714, 1.1, 2.909090909090909, 5.125, 2.6818181818181817]","[""{'precision': -0.09311841428279877, 'recall': -0.01294065173715353, 'f1': -0.051645345985889435}"", ""{'precision': 0.2109493762254715, 'recall': 0.20667512714862823, 'f1': 0.21009676158428192}"", ""{'precision': -0.02898159623146057, 'recall': 0.15586157143115997, 'f1': 0.0632597804069519}"", ""{'precision': 0.25616416335105896, 'recall': 0.3921296298503876, 'f1': 0.32437044382095337}"", ""{'precision': -0.03161277994513512, 'recall': 0.057851266115903854, 'f1': 0.014321071095764637}"", ""{'precision': -0.03530910238623619, 'recall': 0.05106435716152191, 'f1': 0.009115110151469707}"", ""{'precision': -0.35257774591445923, 'recall': -0.09080387651920319, 'f1': -0.22332797944545746}"", ""{'precision': 0.01716284081339836, 'recall': 0.16772548854351044, 'f1': 0.09279683977365494}"", ""{'precision': 0.3477271497249603, 'recall': 0.3651588559150696, 'f1': 0.35747477412223816}"", ""{'precision': 0.4063907563686371, 'recall': 0.23384788632392883, 'f1': 0.3198058307170868}"", ""{'precision': 0.09873276203870773, 'recall': 0.18228335678577423, 'f1': 0.14156284928321838}"", ""{'precision': 0.09469754993915558, 'recall': 0.19298988580703735, 'f1': 0.14476250112056732}"", ""{'precision': 0.32154300808906555, 'recall': 0.36767488718032837, 'f1': 0.345574289560318}"", ""{'precision': -0.08242210745811462, 'recall': 0.07026062160730362, 'f1': -0.005622691474854946}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.0636489987373352, 'recall': 0.29298919439315796, 'f1': 0.17709165811538696}"", ""{'precision': 0.32472991943359375, 'recall': 0.4210628569126129, 'f1': 0.37348079681396484}"", ""{'precision': 0.011358527466654778, 'recall': 0.052887097001075745, 'f1': 0.03360971808433533}"", ""{'precision': 0.17086820304393768, 'recall': 0.14884509146213531, 'f1': 0.16119760274887085}"", ""{'precision': 0.18676285445690155, 'recall': 0.2741827070713043, 'f1': 0.23135605454444885}"", ""{'precision': 0.01473683025687933, 'recall': 0.23198658227920532, 'f1': 0.1224624440073967}"", ""{'precision': 0.31424480676651, 'recall': 0.09978776425123215, 'f1': 0.2060675323009491}"", ""{'precision': -0.09696684777736664, 'recall': 0.08984457701444626, 'f1': -0.0036923084408044815}"", ""{'precision': 0.2577022612094879, 'recall': 0.20712047815322876, 'f1': 0.23353365063667297}"", ""{'precision': 0.04533824324607849, 'recall': 0.1415725201368332, 'f1': 0.09447082877159119}"", ""{'precision': 0.15169040858745575, 'recall': 0.21877674758434296, 'f1': 0.18633955717086792}"", ""{'precision': 0.09471594542264938, 'recall': 0.08893232047557831, 'f1': 0.09329762309789658}"", ""{'precision': 0.13611166179180145, 'recall': 0.09732230752706528, 'f1': 0.11807652562856674}"", ""{'precision': -0.1604962795972824, 'recall': 0.15840131044387817, 'f1': -0.00455790851265192}"", ""{'precision': 0.08433659374713898, 'recall': 0.07663544267416, 'f1': 0.08197701722383499}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1035056673507767, 0.0671608869518552, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2584050114622343, 0.3223659397724296, 0.138290599624506, 0.0, 0.1969509557508073, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0986639785766601, 0.0, 0.0018812325738725, 0.0822918270022972, 0.0246503920127183, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0802679530882732, 0.1523317510883013, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0576822277357025]","[3.9166666666666665, 3.636363636363636, 0.4736842105263157, 3.4285714285714284, 10.0, 4.285714285714286, 3.8, 2.5833333333333335, 1.3548387096774193, 0.8857142857142857, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7333333333333334, 2.4, 5.35, 11.0, 4.888888888888889, 2.9, 2.7142857142857144, 1.9642857142857144, 2.260869565217391, 2.0, 2.2857142857142856, 4.333333333333333, 2.060606060606061, 0.925925925925926, 5.0, 1.7666666666666666, 4.2727272727272725, 8.875, 1.5454545454545454]","[""{'precision': 0.018605075776576996, 'recall': 0.027676809579133987, 'f1': 0.024723809212446213}"", ""{'precision': 0.11408830434083939, 'recall': 0.12945179641246796, 'f1': 0.12318607419729233}"", ""{'precision': -0.044818583875894547, 'recall': 0.039317525923252106, 'f1': -0.0014776296447962523}"", ""{'precision': 0.28842395544052124, 'recall': 0.400706022977829, 'f1': 0.3450360596179962}"", ""{'precision': -0.05558670684695244, 'recall': 0.05271483585238457, 'f1': -0.00039977935375645757}"", ""{'precision': 0.16830281913280487, 'recall': 0.07726295292377472, 'f1': 0.12379739433526993}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.017596537247300148, 'recall': 0.0009918430587276816, 'f1': 0.010889396071434021}"", ""{'precision': 0.3915248215198517, 'recall': 0.3192733824253082, 'f1': 0.35619881749153137}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.22101496160030365, 'recall': 0.1334792971611023, 'f1': 0.17820799350738525}"", ""{'precision': 0.1150352880358696, 'recall': 0.19117280840873718, 'f1': 0.1541975736618042}"", ""{'precision': 0.40110504627227783, 'recall': 0.40135687589645386, 'f1': 0.4022037982940674}"", ""{'precision': -0.0658365860581398, 'recall': 0.0735541507601738, 'f1': 0.004498577211052179}"", ""{'precision': -0.07433929294347763, 'recall': -0.10522875189781189, 'f1': -0.08806341141462326}"", ""{'precision': 0.06748929619789124, 'recall': 0.10652444511651993, 'f1': 0.08841516077518463}"", ""{'precision': 0.3841123580932617, 'recall': 0.2892446517944336, 'f1': 0.3373279571533203}"", ""{'precision': 0.03829863667488098, 'recall': 0.039665237069129944, 'f1': 0.04054334759712219}"", ""{'precision': 0.0621151439845562, 'recall': 0.06140831857919693, 'f1': 0.06328627467155457}"", ""{'precision': 0.2234218567609787, 'recall': 0.2235700637102127, 'f1': 0.22475756704807281}"", ""{'precision': 0.09432080388069153, 'recall': 0.19741639494895935, 'f1': 0.14673668146133423}"", ""{'precision': 0.17018228769302368, 'recall': 0.17701993882656097, 'f1': 0.17494195699691772}"", ""{'precision': -0.05711100995540619, 'recall': 0.15987704694271088, 'f1': 0.05057244002819061}"", ""{'precision': 0.1795092225074768, 'recall': 0.22820739448070526, 'f1': 0.20503807067871094}"", ""{'precision': 0.17392954230308533, 'recall': 0.1660403460264206, 'f1': 0.17133016884326935}"", ""{'precision': 0.24478335678577423, 'recall': 0.23942787945270538, 'f1': 0.2433353066444397}"", ""{'precision': 0.051276274025440216, 'recall': 0.03819303587079048, 'f1': 0.04627799242734909}"", ""{'precision': 0.0014669972006231546, 'recall': 0.09220745414495468, 'f1': 0.04797528684139252}"", ""{'precision': -0.14923645555973053, 'recall': 0.13711276650428772, 'f1': -0.008572653867304325}"", ""{'precision': 0.06578033417463303, 'recall': 0.1044427752494812, 'f1': 0.08652433007955551}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use (with examples): ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Format your answer as follows: (Teaching Method) (Response) Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.280274337093472, 0.0595901505578131, 0.0634508564975691, 0.0, 0.1072481046120325, 0.2331032305449905, 0.1887971609447683, 0.4482468976384072, 0.218167631398606, 0.2372445311148961, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1737546155282429, 0.1121535111154828, 0.1455629308592705, 0.2691694521503486, 0.0387265856899321, 0.1543118895803178, 0.1429861229229596, 0.2223921435844164, 0.1244109327523227, 0.0, 0.1376201412853196, 0.0359484198870081, 0.0885679996609688, 0.1497610494494438]","[2.4166666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 1.7142857142857142, 1.8571428571428572, 2.142857142857143, 2.4, 1.5833333333333333, 0.8064516129032258, 0.3714285714285714, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 3.0, 1.8888888888888888, 1.7, 2.4285714285714284, 1.1071428571428572, 0.9130434782608696, 0.56, 1.4285714285714286, 0.7777777777777778, 0.8181818181818182, 1.2592592592592593, 1.8571428571428572, 0.5333333333333333, 2.090909090909091, 1.875, 0.9090909090909092]","[""{'precision': 0.13864237070083618, 'recall': 0.22377946972846985, 'f1': 0.18218955397605896}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.29420068860054016, 'recall': 0.45664507150650024, 'f1': 0.37520068883895874}"", ""{'precision': 0.13351726531982422, 'recall': 0.29529616236686707, 'f1': 0.21441839635372162}"", ""{'precision': 0.29231661558151245, 'recall': 0.2771975100040436, 'f1': 0.28590792417526245}"", ""{'precision': -0.16725677251815796, 'recall': -0.02978040836751461, 'f1': -0.09770578891038895}"", ""{'precision': 0.218782439827919, 'recall': 0.24108827114105225, 'f1': 0.2311628758907318}"", ""{'precision': 0.24765720963478088, 'recall': 0.2681216597557068, 'f1': 0.25907573103904724}"", ""{'precision': 0.17579273879528046, 'recall': 0.0702231302857399, 'f1': 0.12388003617525101}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.08622314035892487, 'recall': 0.32667577266693115, 'f1': 0.2049374133348465}"", ""{'precision': 0.25753599405288696, 'recall': 0.3161171078681946, 'f1': 0.2878223955631256}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.13379955291748047, 'recall': 0.09721406549215317, 'f1': 0.11687683314085007}"", ""{'precision': 0.015880854800343513, 'recall': 0.0830654427409172, 'f1': 0.05079316720366478}"", ""{'precision': 0.23008720576763153, 'recall': 0.4026769995689392, 'f1': 0.31608065962791443}"", ""{'precision': 0.296329528093338, 'recall': 0.46848103404045105, 'f1': 0.38202130794525146}"", ""{'precision': 0.12538881599903107, 'recall': 0.12354177236557007, 'f1': 0.12588776648044586}"", ""{'precision': 0.3607337772846222, 'recall': 0.31556951999664307, 'f1': 0.33912941813468933}"", ""{'precision': -0.07983797043561935, 'recall': 0.057360295206308365, 'f1': -0.010546828620135784}"", ""{'precision': 0.31597214937210083, 'recall': 0.2876557409763336, 'f1': 0.3029094934463501}"", ""{'precision': 0.09233592450618744, 'recall': 0.2008637934923172, 'f1': 0.14741015434265137}"", ""{'precision': 0.22945044934749603, 'recall': 0.2754858434200287, 'f1': 0.2535819411277771}"", ""{'precision': 0.1828542798757553, 'recall': 0.2094971388578415, 'f1': 0.19744791090488434}"", ""{'precision': 0.10266786813735962, 'recall': 0.19699440896511078, 'f1': 0.1507779061794281}"", ""{'precision': 0.10981395095586777, 'recall': 0.047144029289484024, 'f1': 0.07977928966283798}"", ""{'precision': 0.09698135405778885, 'recall': 0.290243923664093, 'f1': 0.1931089609861374}"", ""{'precision': 0.07298797369003296, 'recall': 0.2475324124097824, 'f1': 0.16013599932193756}"", ""{'precision': 0.09527769684791565, 'recall': 0.10083868354558945, 'f1': 0.09952209889888763}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.0602024057870188, 0.0369230996710913, 0.0334222354874107, 0.0, 0.0172822121316674, 0.2822177794147447, 0.1264396151914723, 0.4482468976384072, 0.2166361496557471, 0.2112315144141515, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1458772459155634, 0.0484547153022719, 0.0976198112765639, 0.1287198804729226, 0.0252047787261781, 0.0963881797449929, 0.0319340280246817, 0.2765885904901324, 0.0176132574100486, 0.0, 0.1542999093435335, 0.2538067443387491, 0.0, 0.1461071665346364]","[2.1666666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 2.7142857142857144, 1.7142857142857142, 2.142857142857143, 1.4, 1.3333333333333333, 0.3870967741935484, 0.6285714285714286, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 4.8, 1.5555555555555556, 2.7, 2.142857142857143, 0.6071428571428571, 1.608695652173913, 1.2, 1.7857142857142858, 1.1111111111111112, 0.4545454545454545, 1.4074074074074074, 3.2857142857142856, 0.5333333333333333, 1.3636363636363635, 5.125, 0.8181818181818182]","[""{'precision': 0.11144650727510452, 'recall': 0.16678740084171295, 'f1': 0.1403663456439972}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.16733106970787048, 'recall': 0.34498879313468933, 'f1': 0.2558545470237732}"", ""{'precision': 0.14777971804141998, 'recall': 0.12287995219230652, 'f1': 0.13670334219932556}"", ""{'precision': 0.14047302305698395, 'recall': 0.16943396627902985, 'f1': 0.15628546476364136}"", ""{'precision': -0.1741969883441925, 'recall': -0.2152625024318695, 'f1': -0.19287870824337006}"", ""{'precision': 0.10095961391925812, 'recall': -0.010690257884562016, 'f1': 0.04605867713689804}"", ""{'precision': 0.4403025507926941, 'recall': 0.15784242749214172, 'f1': 0.29640036821365356}"", ""{'precision': 0.1082160696387291, 'recall': -0.02357855811715126, 'f1': 0.043000295758247375}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.0672667920589447, 'recall': 0.34117069840431213, 'f1': 0.20187444984912872}"", ""{'precision': 0.21142058074474335, 'recall': 0.2578919529914856, 'f1': 0.23579636216163635}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.07662168145179749, 'recall': -0.05927005410194397, 'f1': 0.00935102254152298}"", ""{'precision': -0.02370366081595421, 'recall': -0.02631603181362152, 'f1': -0.02334471233189106}"", ""{'precision': 0.3802837133407593, 'recall': 0.37594321370124817, 'f1': 0.37912291288375854}"", ""{'precision': 0.22057241201400757, 'recall': 0.2892892360687256, 'f1': 0.25591564178466797}"", ""{'precision': 0.13475148379802704, 'recall': -0.040554143488407135, 'f1': 0.047102976590394974}"", ""{'precision': 0.2246946543455124, 'recall': 0.10567621141672134, 'f1': 0.16584555804729462}"", ""{'precision': -0.022776130586862564, 'recall': 0.083047054708004, 'f1': 0.031150298193097115}"", ""{'precision': 0.2631351351737976, 'recall': 0.2743387222290039, 'f1': 0.269919216632843}"", ""{'precision': -0.08870362490415573, 'recall': 0.10129321366548538, 'f1': 0.006090278271585703}"", ""{'precision': 0.42749470472335815, 'recall': 0.1397526115179062, 'f1': 0.28082096576690674}"", ""{'precision': 0.06014829874038696, 'recall': 0.12220893800258636, 'f1': 0.09246557205915451}"", ""{'precision': 0.2430046945810318, 'recall': 0.3270018994808197, 'f1': 0.2858295142650604}"", ""{'precision': 0.14836622774600983, 'recall': 0.00877873133867979, 'f1': 0.07909627258777618}"", ""{'precision': 0.2596312463283539, 'recall': 0.2833509147167206, 'f1': 0.2726484537124634}"", ""{'precision': -0.04212549328804016, 'recall': 0.2262428104877472, 'f1': 0.0899641290307045}"", ""{'precision': 0.13963252305984497, 'recall': 0.06494591385126114, 'f1': 0.10346974432468414}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  Directly answer the student's question.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.1387281377207149, 0.0326287712524776, 0.0931273669314074, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3685939814893283, 0.3223659397724296, 0.2835382546816534, 0.0353186986044697, 0.2098288242723427, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1303345371663271, 0.1411195762450153, 0.2307743706703186, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1447803716874165, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0144460941817118, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.0833333333333335, 1.6363636363636365, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7857142857142856, 5.142857142857143, 8.285714285714286, 3.8, 3.6666666666666665, 0.7741935483870968, 0.8857142857142857, 1.2105263157894737, 2.0, 2.3333333333333335, 2.75, 6.8, 6.888888888888889, 3.7, 5.571428571428571, 0.9642857142857144, 1.6521739130434785, 0.92, 3.2857142857142856, 5.111111111111111, 1.4848484848484849, 2.2222222222222223, 4.571428571428571, 1.3666666666666667, 2.727272727272727, 8.75, 2.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.11432495713233948, 'recall': 0.03324726223945618, 'f1': 0.07496145367622375}"", ""{'precision': 0.34705960750579834, 'recall': 0.16323672235012054, 'f1': 0.2547290027141571}"", ""{'precision': -0.04055697098374367, 'recall': 0.13544459640979767, 'f1': 0.047443777322769165}"", ""{'precision': 0.2874433696269989, 'recall': 0.3909418284893036, 'f1': 0.33976122736930847}"", ""{'precision': 0.013704590499401093, 'recall': 0.1261105239391327, 'f1': 0.07079096138477325}"", ""{'precision': 0.0022958312183618546, 'recall': 0.0070695350877940655, 'f1': 0.006298996973782778}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.04759303852915764, 'recall': 0.14297078549861908, 'f1': 0.09630267322063446}"", ""{'precision': 0.5061132907867432, 'recall': 0.3179398477077484, 'f1': 0.4113249182701111}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.3297567069530487, 'recall': 0.20683324337005615, 'f1': 0.268756240606308}"", ""{'precision': 0.0749378353357315, 'recall': 0.11573436856269836, 'f1': 0.09672435373067856}"", ""{'precision': 0.4073179364204407, 'recall': 0.39869120717048645, 'f1': 0.4039713740348816}"", ""{'precision': -0.009095241315662861, 'recall': 0.020507877692580223, 'f1': 0.007277961820363998}"", ""{'precision': -0.06473217904567719, 'recall': -0.034142181277275085, 'f1': -0.047779280692338943}"", ""{'precision': -0.04261331260204315, 'recall': 0.1446707844734192, 'f1': 0.050818946212530136}"", ""{'precision': 0.3305618166923523, 'recall': 0.26773256063461304, 'f1': 0.30009621381759644}"", ""{'precision': -0.031261153519153595, 'recall': 0.018836529925465584, 'f1': -0.004703410901129246}"", ""{'precision': 0.15156836807727814, 'recall': 0.07251915335655212, 'f1': 0.11317533999681473}"", ""{'precision': 0.22911085188388824, 'recall': 0.17426548898220062, 'f1': 0.20283786952495575}"", ""{'precision': 0.24250556528568268, 'recall': 0.2621985375881195, 'f1': 0.2535487413406372}"", ""{'precision': 0.19026708602905273, 'recall': 0.1819763332605362, 'f1': 0.18744036555290222}"", ""{'precision': -0.07508712261915207, 'recall': 0.037153083831071854, 'f1': -0.017948396503925323}"", ""{'precision': 0.2166709154844284, 'recall': 0.17746104300022125, 'f1': 0.19829514622688293}"", ""{'precision': 0.07609530538320541, 'recall': 0.12819607555866241, 'f1': 0.10347115993499756}"", ""{'precision': 0.23566016554832458, 'recall': 0.2002030313014984, 'f1': 0.2191401720046997}"", ""{'precision': 0.039474498480558395, 'recall': 0.03034212253987789, 'f1': 0.03647209703922272}"", ""{'precision': 0.17368051409721375, 'recall': 0.15962590277194977, 'f1': 0.16799703240394592}"", ""{'precision': -0.06723884493112564, 'recall': 0.22073249518871307, 'f1': 0.07412375509738922}"", ""{'precision': 0.13290952146053314, 'recall': 0.07355167716741562, 'f1': 0.1045115739107132}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1231552158867506, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1595867466221573, 0.2816988029230364, 0.0375123027908174, 0.0, 0.121658365925153, 0.0026883850904072, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1601171066931316, 0.0, 0.118127981268613, 0.023413470249148, 0.1743353397675923, 0.017465844953817, 0.0, 0.1669695384489661, 0.1627683104536919, 0.0, 0.0606433872310888, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.1666666666666665, 3.8181818181818183, 1.105263157894737, 4.357142857142857, 8.142857142857142, 8.285714285714286, 6.2, 3.6666666666666665, 1.903225806451613, 1.0285714285714285, 2.5789473684210527, 4.0, 2.8666666666666667, 2.15, 5.8, 4.333333333333333, 2.3, 6.714285714285714, 1.5357142857142858, 2.869565217391304, 1.24, 2.0714285714285716, 3.111111111111111, 1.5454545454545454, 1.037037037037037, 4.714285714285714, 1.2666666666666666, 2.4545454545454546, 2.25, 3.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.10684812068939209, 'recall': 0.03631405159831047, 'f1': 0.07283965498209}"", ""{'precision': 0.18081633746623993, 'recall': 0.21930274367332458, 'f1': 0.20128819346427917}"", ""{'precision': 0.17166095972061157, 'recall': 0.13189461827278137, 'f1': 0.15307734906673431}"", ""{'precision': 0.2035761922597885, 'recall': 0.36162516474723816, 'f1': 0.28257477283477783}"", ""{'precision': -0.007911596447229385, 'recall': 0.07360721379518509, 'f1': 0.03408719226717949}"", ""{'precision': -0.029209056869149208, 'recall': -0.0254511758685112, 'f1': -0.025661807507276535}"", ""{'precision': -0.28529930114746094, 'recall': -0.1471974402666092, 'f1': -0.21527764201164246}"", ""{'precision': 0.06908895075321198, 'recall': 0.19120818376541138, 'f1': 0.1308295577764511}"", ""{'precision': 0.24328982830047607, 'recall': 0.3773156702518463, 'f1': 0.3105713427066803}"", ""{'precision': 0.37962114810943604, 'recall': 0.23239125311374664, 'f1': 0.30609819293022156}"", ""{'precision': 0.14460481703281403, 'recall': 0.2137676626443863, 'f1': 0.18028776347637177}"", ""{'precision': 0.054828621447086334, 'recall': 0.1578940600156784, 'f1': 0.10728989541530609}"", ""{'precision': 0.3231819272041321, 'recall': 0.42914193868637085, 'f1': 0.3766500651836395}"", ""{'precision': 0.06238151714205742, 'recall': 0.07595311105251312, 'f1': 0.07067088782787323}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.040648944675922394, 'recall': 0.0014439028454944491, 'f1': 0.02255857363343239}"", ""{'precision': 0.33503711223602295, 'recall': 0.3662688434123993, 'f1': 0.3516627848148346}"", ""{'precision': -0.0808199793100357, 'recall': 0.04339419677853584, 'f1': -0.017838211730122566}"", ""{'precision': 0.17228850722312927, 'recall': 0.16112887859344482, 'f1': 0.16805635392665863}"", ""{'precision': 0.16065724194049835, 'recall': 0.2842628061771393, 'f1': 0.22298717498779297}"", ""{'precision': 0.19424818456172943, 'recall': 0.25405827164649963, 'f1': 0.22524210810661316}"", ""{'precision': 0.20658765733242035, 'recall': 0.1472964882850647, 'f1': 0.17810629308223724}"", ""{'precision': 0.02119770273566246, 'recall': 0.08223419636487961, 'f1': 0.0530717670917511}"", ""{'precision': 0.3092431426048279, 'recall': 0.23614603281021118, 'f1': 0.273618221282959}"", ""{'precision': 0.15373331308364868, 'recall': 0.1726284623146057, 'f1': 0.16452297568321228}"", ""{'precision': 0.1746618002653122, 'recall': 0.22373667359352112, 'f1': 0.20038409531116486}"", ""{'precision': 0.08880196511745453, 'recall': 0.07461851090192795, 'f1': 0.08319153636693954}"", ""{'precision': 0.1476742923259735, 'recall': 0.07884303480386734, 'f1': 0.11446332186460495}"", ""{'precision': -0.23309831321239471, 'recall': 0.09990908950567245, 'f1': -0.07053916156291962}"", ""{'precision': 0.03019283153116703, 'recall': 0.08091480284929276, 'f1': 0.05696043372154236}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.01413928988305, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.232914392851028, 0.288552621816469, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0777051775670442, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1016052632718472, 0.0, 0.1037397015701301, 0.0456987312059718, 0.0722312220036983, 0.1387480518647602, 0.0, 0.1161288667856411, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0851336600337967, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[5.666666666666667, 2.636363636363636, 2.789473684210526, 3.928571428571429, 6.714285714285714, 6.142857142857143, 7.0, 4.25, 1.4838709677419355, 1.0285714285714285, 2.789473684210526, 3.4, 3.0, 4.9, 5.8, 6.111111111111111, 2.5, 5.142857142857143, 1.5357142857142858, 2.652173913043478, 1.64, 1.1428571428571428, 6.888888888888889, 1.8484848484848484, 3.0, 5.714285714285714, 1.1, 2.909090909090909, 5.125, 2.6818181818181817]","[""{'precision': -0.09311841428279877, 'recall': -0.01294065173715353, 'f1': -0.051645345985889435}"", ""{'precision': 0.2109493762254715, 'recall': 0.20667512714862823, 'f1': 0.21009676158428192}"", ""{'precision': -0.02898159623146057, 'recall': 0.15586157143115997, 'f1': 0.0632597804069519}"", ""{'precision': 0.25616416335105896, 'recall': 0.3921296298503876, 'f1': 0.32437044382095337}"", ""{'precision': -0.03161277994513512, 'recall': 0.057851266115903854, 'f1': 0.014321071095764637}"", ""{'precision': -0.03530910238623619, 'recall': 0.05106435716152191, 'f1': 0.009115110151469707}"", ""{'precision': -0.35257774591445923, 'recall': -0.09080387651920319, 'f1': -0.22332797944545746}"", ""{'precision': 0.01716284081339836, 'recall': 0.16772548854351044, 'f1': 0.09279683977365494}"", ""{'precision': 0.3477271497249603, 'recall': 0.3651588559150696, 'f1': 0.35747477412223816}"", ""{'precision': 0.4063907563686371, 'recall': 0.23384788632392883, 'f1': 0.3198058307170868}"", ""{'precision': 0.09873276203870773, 'recall': 0.18228335678577423, 'f1': 0.14156284928321838}"", ""{'precision': 0.09469754993915558, 'recall': 0.19298988580703735, 'f1': 0.14476250112056732}"", ""{'precision': 0.32154300808906555, 'recall': 0.36767488718032837, 'f1': 0.345574289560318}"", ""{'precision': -0.08242210745811462, 'recall': 0.07026062160730362, 'f1': -0.005622691474854946}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.0636489987373352, 'recall': 0.29298919439315796, 'f1': 0.17709165811538696}"", ""{'precision': 0.32472991943359375, 'recall': 0.4210628569126129, 'f1': 0.37348079681396484}"", ""{'precision': 0.011358527466654778, 'recall': 0.052887097001075745, 'f1': 0.03360971808433533}"", ""{'precision': 0.17086820304393768, 'recall': 0.14884509146213531, 'f1': 0.16119760274887085}"", ""{'precision': 0.18676285445690155, 'recall': 0.2741827070713043, 'f1': 0.23135605454444885}"", ""{'precision': 0.01473683025687933, 'recall': 0.23198658227920532, 'f1': 0.1224624440073967}"", ""{'precision': 0.31424480676651, 'recall': 0.09978776425123215, 'f1': 0.2060675323009491}"", ""{'precision': -0.09696684777736664, 'recall': 0.08984457701444626, 'f1': -0.0036923084408044815}"", ""{'precision': 0.2577022612094879, 'recall': 0.20712047815322876, 'f1': 0.23353365063667297}"", ""{'precision': 0.04533824324607849, 'recall': 0.1415725201368332, 'f1': 0.09447082877159119}"", ""{'precision': 0.15169040858745575, 'recall': 0.21877674758434296, 'f1': 0.18633955717086792}"", ""{'precision': 0.09471594542264938, 'recall': 0.08893232047557831, 'f1': 0.09329762309789658}"", ""{'precision': 0.13611166179180145, 'recall': 0.09732230752706528, 'f1': 0.11807652562856674}"", ""{'precision': -0.1604962795972824, 'recall': 0.15840131044387817, 'f1': -0.00455790851265192}"", ""{'precision': 0.08433659374713898, 'recall': 0.07663544267416, 'f1': 0.08197701722383499}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1035056673507767, 0.0671608869518552, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2584050114622343, 0.3223659397724296, 0.138290599624506, 0.0, 0.1969509557508073, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0986639785766601, 0.0, 0.0018812325738725, 0.0822918270022972, 0.0246503920127183, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0802679530882732, 0.1523317510883013, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0576822277357025]","[3.9166666666666665, 3.636363636363636, 0.4736842105263157, 3.4285714285714284, 10.0, 4.285714285714286, 3.8, 2.5833333333333335, 1.3548387096774193, 0.8857142857142857, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7333333333333334, 2.4, 5.35, 11.0, 4.888888888888889, 2.9, 2.7142857142857144, 1.9642857142857144, 2.260869565217391, 2.0, 2.2857142857142856, 4.333333333333333, 2.060606060606061, 0.925925925925926, 5.0, 1.7666666666666666, 4.2727272727272725, 8.875, 1.5454545454545454]","[""{'precision': 0.018605075776576996, 'recall': 0.027676809579133987, 'f1': 0.024723809212446213}"", ""{'precision': 0.11408830434083939, 'recall': 0.12945179641246796, 'f1': 0.12318607419729233}"", ""{'precision': -0.044818583875894547, 'recall': 0.039317525923252106, 'f1': -0.0014776296447962523}"", ""{'precision': 0.28842395544052124, 'recall': 0.400706022977829, 'f1': 0.3450360596179962}"", ""{'precision': -0.05558670684695244, 'recall': 0.05271483585238457, 'f1': -0.00039977935375645757}"", ""{'precision': 0.16830281913280487, 'recall': 0.07726295292377472, 'f1': 0.12379739433526993}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.017596537247300148, 'recall': 0.0009918430587276816, 'f1': 0.010889396071434021}"", ""{'precision': 0.3915248215198517, 'recall': 0.3192733824253082, 'f1': 0.35619881749153137}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.22101496160030365, 'recall': 0.1334792971611023, 'f1': 0.17820799350738525}"", ""{'precision': 0.1150352880358696, 'recall': 0.19117280840873718, 'f1': 0.1541975736618042}"", ""{'precision': 0.40110504627227783, 'recall': 0.40135687589645386, 'f1': 0.4022037982940674}"", ""{'precision': -0.0658365860581398, 'recall': 0.0735541507601738, 'f1': 0.004498577211052179}"", ""{'precision': -0.07433929294347763, 'recall': -0.10522875189781189, 'f1': -0.08806341141462326}"", ""{'precision': 0.06748929619789124, 'recall': 0.10652444511651993, 'f1': 0.08841516077518463}"", ""{'precision': 0.3841123580932617, 'recall': 0.2892446517944336, 'f1': 0.3373279571533203}"", ""{'precision': 0.03829863667488098, 'recall': 0.039665237069129944, 'f1': 0.04054334759712219}"", ""{'precision': 0.0621151439845562, 'recall': 0.06140831857919693, 'f1': 0.06328627467155457}"", ""{'precision': 0.2234218567609787, 'recall': 0.2235700637102127, 'f1': 0.22475756704807281}"", ""{'precision': 0.09432080388069153, 'recall': 0.19741639494895935, 'f1': 0.14673668146133423}"", ""{'precision': 0.17018228769302368, 'recall': 0.17701993882656097, 'f1': 0.17494195699691772}"", ""{'precision': -0.05711100995540619, 'recall': 0.15987704694271088, 'f1': 0.05057244002819061}"", ""{'precision': 0.1795092225074768, 'recall': 0.22820739448070526, 'f1': 0.20503807067871094}"", ""{'precision': 0.17392954230308533, 'recall': 0.1660403460264206, 'f1': 0.17133016884326935}"", ""{'precision': 0.24478335678577423, 'recall': 0.23942787945270538, 'f1': 0.2433353066444397}"", ""{'precision': 0.051276274025440216, 'recall': 0.03819303587079048, 'f1': 0.04627799242734909}"", ""{'precision': 0.0014669972006231546, 'recall': 0.09220745414495468, 'f1': 0.04797528684139252}"", ""{'precision': -0.14923645555973053, 'recall': 0.13711276650428772, 'f1': -0.008572653867304325}"", ""{'precision': 0.06578033417463303, 'recall': 0.1044427752494812, 'f1': 0.08652433007955551}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use (with examples): ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Format your answer as follows: (Teaching Method) (Response) Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.280274337093472, 0.0595901505578131, 0.0634508564975691, 0.0, 0.1072481046120325, 0.2331032305449905, 0.1887971609447683, 0.4482468976384072, 0.218167631398606, 0.2372445311148961, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1737546155282429, 0.1121535111154828, 0.1455629308592705, 0.2691694521503486, 0.0387265856899321, 0.1543118895803178, 0.1429861229229596, 0.2223921435844164, 0.1244109327523227, 0.0, 0.1376201412853196, 0.0359484198870081, 0.0885679996609688, 0.1497610494494438]","[2.4166666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 1.7142857142857142, 1.8571428571428572, 2.142857142857143, 2.4, 1.5833333333333333, 0.8064516129032258, 0.3714285714285714, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 3.0, 1.8888888888888888, 1.7, 2.4285714285714284, 1.1071428571428572, 0.9130434782608696, 0.56, 1.4285714285714286, 0.7777777777777778, 0.8181818181818182, 1.2592592592592593, 1.8571428571428572, 0.5333333333333333, 2.090909090909091, 1.875, 0.9090909090909092]","[""{'precision': 0.13864237070083618, 'recall': 0.22377946972846985, 'f1': 0.18218955397605896}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.29420068860054016, 'recall': 0.45664507150650024, 'f1': 0.37520068883895874}"", ""{'precision': 0.13351726531982422, 'recall': 0.29529616236686707, 'f1': 0.21441839635372162}"", ""{'precision': 0.29231661558151245, 'recall': 0.2771975100040436, 'f1': 0.28590792417526245}"", ""{'precision': -0.16725677251815796, 'recall': -0.02978040836751461, 'f1': -0.09770578891038895}"", ""{'precision': 0.218782439827919, 'recall': 0.24108827114105225, 'f1': 0.2311628758907318}"", ""{'precision': 0.24765720963478088, 'recall': 0.2681216597557068, 'f1': 0.25907573103904724}"", ""{'precision': 0.17579273879528046, 'recall': 0.0702231302857399, 'f1': 0.12388003617525101}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.08622314035892487, 'recall': 0.32667577266693115, 'f1': 0.2049374133348465}"", ""{'precision': 0.25753599405288696, 'recall': 0.3161171078681946, 'f1': 0.2878223955631256}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.13379955291748047, 'recall': 0.09721406549215317, 'f1': 0.11687683314085007}"", ""{'precision': 0.015880854800343513, 'recall': 0.0830654427409172, 'f1': 0.05079316720366478}"", ""{'precision': 0.23008720576763153, 'recall': 0.4026769995689392, 'f1': 0.31608065962791443}"", ""{'precision': 0.296329528093338, 'recall': 0.46848103404045105, 'f1': 0.38202130794525146}"", ""{'precision': 0.12538881599903107, 'recall': 0.12354177236557007, 'f1': 0.12588776648044586}"", ""{'precision': 0.3607337772846222, 'recall': 0.31556951999664307, 'f1': 0.33912941813468933}"", ""{'precision': -0.07983797043561935, 'recall': 0.057360295206308365, 'f1': -0.010546828620135784}"", ""{'precision': 0.31597214937210083, 'recall': 0.2876557409763336, 'f1': 0.3029094934463501}"", ""{'precision': 0.09233592450618744, 'recall': 0.2008637934923172, 'f1': 0.14741015434265137}"", ""{'precision': 0.22945044934749603, 'recall': 0.2754858434200287, 'f1': 0.2535819411277771}"", ""{'precision': 0.1828542798757553, 'recall': 0.2094971388578415, 'f1': 0.19744791090488434}"", ""{'precision': 0.10266786813735962, 'recall': 0.19699440896511078, 'f1': 0.1507779061794281}"", ""{'precision': 0.10981395095586777, 'recall': 0.047144029289484024, 'f1': 0.07977928966283798}"", ""{'precision': 0.09698135405778885, 'recall': 0.290243923664093, 'f1': 0.1931089609861374}"", ""{'precision': 0.07298797369003296, 'recall': 0.2475324124097824, 'f1': 0.16013599932193756}"", ""{'precision': 0.09527769684791565, 'recall': 0.10083868354558945, 'f1': 0.09952209889888763}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.0602024057870188, 0.0369230996710913, 0.0334222354874107, 0.0, 0.0172822121316674, 0.2822177794147447, 0.1264396151914723, 0.4482468976384072, 0.2166361496557471, 0.2112315144141515, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1458772459155634, 0.0484547153022719, 0.0976198112765639, 0.1287198804729226, 0.0252047787261781, 0.0963881797449929, 0.0319340280246817, 0.2765885904901324, 0.0176132574100486, 0.0, 0.1542999093435335, 0.2538067443387491, 0.0, 0.1461071665346364]","[2.1666666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 2.7142857142857144, 1.7142857142857142, 2.142857142857143, 1.4, 1.3333333333333333, 0.3870967741935484, 0.6285714285714286, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 4.8, 1.5555555555555556, 2.7, 2.142857142857143, 0.6071428571428571, 1.608695652173913, 1.2, 1.7857142857142858, 1.1111111111111112, 0.4545454545454545, 1.4074074074074074, 3.2857142857142856, 0.5333333333333333, 1.3636363636363635, 5.125, 0.8181818181818182]","[""{'precision': 0.11144650727510452, 'recall': 0.16678740084171295, 'f1': 0.1403663456439972}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.16733106970787048, 'recall': 0.34498879313468933, 'f1': 0.2558545470237732}"", ""{'precision': 0.14777971804141998, 'recall': 0.12287995219230652, 'f1': 0.13670334219932556}"", ""{'precision': 0.14047302305698395, 'recall': 0.16943396627902985, 'f1': 0.15628546476364136}"", ""{'precision': -0.1741969883441925, 'recall': -0.2152625024318695, 'f1': -0.19287870824337006}"", ""{'precision': 0.10095961391925812, 'recall': -0.010690257884562016, 'f1': 0.04605867713689804}"", ""{'precision': 0.4403025507926941, 'recall': 0.15784242749214172, 'f1': 0.29640036821365356}"", ""{'precision': 0.1082160696387291, 'recall': -0.02357855811715126, 'f1': 0.043000295758247375}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.0672667920589447, 'recall': 0.34117069840431213, 'f1': 0.20187444984912872}"", ""{'precision': 0.21142058074474335, 'recall': 0.2578919529914856, 'f1': 0.23579636216163635}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.07662168145179749, 'recall': -0.05927005410194397, 'f1': 0.00935102254152298}"", ""{'precision': -0.02370366081595421, 'recall': -0.02631603181362152, 'f1': -0.02334471233189106}"", ""{'precision': 0.3802837133407593, 'recall': 0.37594321370124817, 'f1': 0.37912291288375854}"", ""{'precision': 0.22057241201400757, 'recall': 0.2892892360687256, 'f1': 0.25591564178466797}"", ""{'precision': 0.13475148379802704, 'recall': -0.040554143488407135, 'f1': 0.047102976590394974}"", ""{'precision': 0.2246946543455124, 'recall': 0.10567621141672134, 'f1': 0.16584555804729462}"", ""{'precision': -0.022776130586862564, 'recall': 0.083047054708004, 'f1': 0.031150298193097115}"", ""{'precision': 0.2631351351737976, 'recall': 0.2743387222290039, 'f1': 0.269919216632843}"", ""{'precision': -0.08870362490415573, 'recall': 0.10129321366548538, 'f1': 0.006090278271585703}"", ""{'precision': 0.42749470472335815, 'recall': 0.1397526115179062, 'f1': 0.28082096576690674}"", ""{'precision': 0.06014829874038696, 'recall': 0.12220893800258636, 'f1': 0.09246557205915451}"", ""{'precision': 0.2430046945810318, 'recall': 0.3270018994808197, 'f1': 0.2858295142650604}"", ""{'precision': 0.14836622774600983, 'recall': 0.00877873133867979, 'f1': 0.07909627258777618}"", ""{'precision': 0.2596312463283539, 'recall': 0.2833509147167206, 'f1': 0.2726484537124634}"", ""{'precision': -0.04212549328804016, 'recall': 0.2262428104877472, 'f1': 0.0899641290307045}"", ""{'precision': 0.13963252305984497, 'recall': 0.06494591385126114, 'f1': 0.10346974432468414}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  Directly answer the student's question.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.1387281377207149, 0.0326287712524776, 0.0931273669314074, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3685939814893283, 0.3223659397724296, 0.2835382546816534, 0.0353186986044697, 0.2098288242723427, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1303345371663271, 0.1411195762450153, 0.2307743706703186, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1447803716874165, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0144460941817118, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.0833333333333335, 1.6363636363636365, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7857142857142856, 5.142857142857143, 8.285714285714286, 3.8, 3.6666666666666665, 0.7741935483870968, 0.8857142857142857, 1.2105263157894737, 2.0, 2.3333333333333335, 2.75, 6.8, 6.888888888888889, 3.7, 5.571428571428571, 0.9642857142857144, 1.6521739130434785, 0.92, 3.2857142857142856, 5.111111111111111, 1.4848484848484849, 2.2222222222222223, 4.571428571428571, 1.3666666666666667, 2.727272727272727, 8.75, 2.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.11432495713233948, 'recall': 0.03324726223945618, 'f1': 0.07496145367622375}"", ""{'precision': 0.34705960750579834, 'recall': 0.16323672235012054, 'f1': 0.2547290027141571}"", ""{'precision': -0.04055697098374367, 'recall': 0.13544459640979767, 'f1': 0.047443777322769165}"", ""{'precision': 0.2874433696269989, 'recall': 0.3909418284893036, 'f1': 0.33976122736930847}"", ""{'precision': 0.013704590499401093, 'recall': 0.1261105239391327, 'f1': 0.07079096138477325}"", ""{'precision': 0.0022958312183618546, 'recall': 0.0070695350877940655, 'f1': 0.006298996973782778}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.04759303852915764, 'recall': 0.14297078549861908, 'f1': 0.09630267322063446}"", ""{'precision': 0.5061132907867432, 'recall': 0.3179398477077484, 'f1': 0.4113249182701111}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.3297567069530487, 'recall': 0.20683324337005615, 'f1': 0.268756240606308}"", ""{'precision': 0.0749378353357315, 'recall': 0.11573436856269836, 'f1': 0.09672435373067856}"", ""{'precision': 0.4073179364204407, 'recall': 0.39869120717048645, 'f1': 0.4039713740348816}"", ""{'precision': -0.009095241315662861, 'recall': 0.020507877692580223, 'f1': 0.007277961820363998}"", ""{'precision': -0.06473217904567719, 'recall': -0.034142181277275085, 'f1': -0.047779280692338943}"", ""{'precision': -0.04261331260204315, 'recall': 0.1446707844734192, 'f1': 0.050818946212530136}"", ""{'precision': 0.3305618166923523, 'recall': 0.26773256063461304, 'f1': 0.30009621381759644}"", ""{'precision': -0.031261153519153595, 'recall': 0.018836529925465584, 'f1': -0.004703410901129246}"", ""{'precision': 0.15156836807727814, 'recall': 0.07251915335655212, 'f1': 0.11317533999681473}"", ""{'precision': 0.22911085188388824, 'recall': 0.17426548898220062, 'f1': 0.20283786952495575}"", ""{'precision': 0.24250556528568268, 'recall': 0.2621985375881195, 'f1': 0.2535487413406372}"", ""{'precision': 0.19026708602905273, 'recall': 0.1819763332605362, 'f1': 0.18744036555290222}"", ""{'precision': -0.07508712261915207, 'recall': 0.037153083831071854, 'f1': -0.017948396503925323}"", ""{'precision': 0.2166709154844284, 'recall': 0.17746104300022125, 'f1': 0.19829514622688293}"", ""{'precision': 0.07609530538320541, 'recall': 0.12819607555866241, 'f1': 0.10347115993499756}"", ""{'precision': 0.23566016554832458, 'recall': 0.2002030313014984, 'f1': 0.2191401720046997}"", ""{'precision': 0.039474498480558395, 'recall': 0.03034212253987789, 'f1': 0.03647209703922272}"", ""{'precision': 0.17368051409721375, 'recall': 0.15962590277194977, 'f1': 0.16799703240394592}"", ""{'precision': -0.06723884493112564, 'recall': 0.22073249518871307, 'f1': 0.07412375509738922}"", ""{'precision': 0.13290952146053314, 'recall': 0.07355167716741562, 'f1': 0.1045115739107132}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1231552158867506, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1595867466221573, 0.2816988029230364, 0.0375123027908174, 0.0, 0.121658365925153, 0.0026883850904072, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1601171066931316, 0.0, 0.118127981268613, 0.023413470249148, 0.1743353397675923, 0.017465844953817, 0.0, 0.1669695384489661, 0.1627683104536919, 0.0, 0.0606433872310888, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.1666666666666665, 3.8181818181818183, 1.105263157894737, 4.357142857142857, 8.142857142857142, 8.285714285714286, 6.2, 3.6666666666666665, 1.903225806451613, 1.0285714285714285, 2.5789473684210527, 4.0, 2.8666666666666667, 2.15, 5.8, 4.333333333333333, 2.3, 6.714285714285714, 1.5357142857142858, 2.869565217391304, 1.24, 2.0714285714285716, 3.111111111111111, 1.5454545454545454, 1.037037037037037, 4.714285714285714, 1.2666666666666666, 2.4545454545454546, 2.25, 3.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.10684812068939209, 'recall': 0.03631405159831047, 'f1': 0.07283965498209}"", ""{'precision': 0.18081633746623993, 'recall': 0.21930274367332458, 'f1': 0.20128819346427917}"", ""{'precision': 0.17166095972061157, 'recall': 0.13189461827278137, 'f1': 0.15307734906673431}"", ""{'precision': 0.2035761922597885, 'recall': 0.36162516474723816, 'f1': 0.28257477283477783}"", ""{'precision': -0.007911596447229385, 'recall': 0.07360721379518509, 'f1': 0.03408719226717949}"", ""{'precision': -0.029209056869149208, 'recall': -0.0254511758685112, 'f1': -0.025661807507276535}"", ""{'precision': -0.28529930114746094, 'recall': -0.1471974402666092, 'f1': -0.21527764201164246}"", ""{'precision': 0.06908895075321198, 'recall': 0.19120818376541138, 'f1': 0.1308295577764511}"", ""{'precision': 0.24328982830047607, 'recall': 0.3773156702518463, 'f1': 0.3105713427066803}"", ""{'precision': 0.37962114810943604, 'recall': 0.23239125311374664, 'f1': 0.30609819293022156}"", ""{'precision': 0.14460481703281403, 'recall': 0.2137676626443863, 'f1': 0.18028776347637177}"", ""{'precision': 0.054828621447086334, 'recall': 0.1578940600156784, 'f1': 0.10728989541530609}"", ""{'precision': 0.3231819272041321, 'recall': 0.42914193868637085, 'f1': 0.3766500651836395}"", ""{'precision': 0.06238151714205742, 'recall': 0.07595311105251312, 'f1': 0.07067088782787323}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.040648944675922394, 'recall': 0.0014439028454944491, 'f1': 0.02255857363343239}"", ""{'precision': 0.33503711223602295, 'recall': 0.3662688434123993, 'f1': 0.3516627848148346}"", ""{'precision': -0.0808199793100357, 'recall': 0.04339419677853584, 'f1': -0.017838211730122566}"", ""{'precision': 0.17228850722312927, 'recall': 0.16112887859344482, 'f1': 0.16805635392665863}"", ""{'precision': 0.16065724194049835, 'recall': 0.2842628061771393, 'f1': 0.22298717498779297}"", ""{'precision': 0.19424818456172943, 'recall': 0.25405827164649963, 'f1': 0.22524210810661316}"", ""{'precision': 0.20658765733242035, 'recall': 0.1472964882850647, 'f1': 0.17810629308223724}"", ""{'precision': 0.02119770273566246, 'recall': 0.08223419636487961, 'f1': 0.0530717670917511}"", ""{'precision': 0.3092431426048279, 'recall': 0.23614603281021118, 'f1': 0.273618221282959}"", ""{'precision': 0.15373331308364868, 'recall': 0.1726284623146057, 'f1': 0.16452297568321228}"", ""{'precision': 0.1746618002653122, 'recall': 0.22373667359352112, 'f1': 0.20038409531116486}"", ""{'precision': 0.08880196511745453, 'recall': 0.07461851090192795, 'f1': 0.08319153636693954}"", ""{'precision': 0.1476742923259735, 'recall': 0.07884303480386734, 'f1': 0.11446332186460495}"", ""{'precision': -0.23309831321239471, 'recall': 0.09990908950567245, 'f1': -0.07053916156291962}"", ""{'precision': 0.03019283153116703, 'recall': 0.08091480284929276, 'f1': 0.05696043372154236}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.01413928988305, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.232914392851028, 0.288552621816469, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0777051775670442, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1016052632718472, 0.0, 0.1037397015701301, 0.0456987312059718, 0.0722312220036983, 0.1387480518647602, 0.0, 0.1161288667856411, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0851336600337967, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[5.666666666666667, 2.636363636363636, 2.789473684210526, 3.928571428571429, 6.714285714285714, 6.142857142857143, 7.0, 4.25, 1.4838709677419355, 1.0285714285714285, 2.789473684210526, 3.4, 3.0, 4.9, 5.8, 6.111111111111111, 2.5, 5.142857142857143, 1.5357142857142858, 2.652173913043478, 1.64, 1.1428571428571428, 6.888888888888889, 1.8484848484848484, 3.0, 5.714285714285714, 1.1, 2.909090909090909, 5.125, 2.6818181818181817]","[""{'precision': -0.09311841428279877, 'recall': -0.01294065173715353, 'f1': -0.051645345985889435}"", ""{'precision': 0.2109493762254715, 'recall': 0.20667512714862823, 'f1': 0.21009676158428192}"", ""{'precision': -0.02898159623146057, 'recall': 0.15586157143115997, 'f1': 0.0632597804069519}"", ""{'precision': 0.25616416335105896, 'recall': 0.3921296298503876, 'f1': 0.32437044382095337}"", ""{'precision': -0.03161277994513512, 'recall': 0.057851266115903854, 'f1': 0.014321071095764637}"", ""{'precision': -0.03530910238623619, 'recall': 0.05106435716152191, 'f1': 0.009115110151469707}"", ""{'precision': -0.35257774591445923, 'recall': -0.09080387651920319, 'f1': -0.22332797944545746}"", ""{'precision': 0.01716284081339836, 'recall': 0.16772548854351044, 'f1': 0.09279683977365494}"", ""{'precision': 0.3477271497249603, 'recall': 0.3651588559150696, 'f1': 0.35747477412223816}"", ""{'precision': 0.4063907563686371, 'recall': 0.23384788632392883, 'f1': 0.3198058307170868}"", ""{'precision': 0.09873276203870773, 'recall': 0.18228335678577423, 'f1': 0.14156284928321838}"", ""{'precision': 0.09469754993915558, 'recall': 0.19298988580703735, 'f1': 0.14476250112056732}"", ""{'precision': 0.32154300808906555, 'recall': 0.36767488718032837, 'f1': 0.345574289560318}"", ""{'precision': -0.08242210745811462, 'recall': 0.07026062160730362, 'f1': -0.005622691474854946}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.0636489987373352, 'recall': 0.29298919439315796, 'f1': 0.17709165811538696}"", ""{'precision': 0.32472991943359375, 'recall': 0.4210628569126129, 'f1': 0.37348079681396484}"", ""{'precision': 0.011358527466654778, 'recall': 0.052887097001075745, 'f1': 0.03360971808433533}"", ""{'precision': 0.17086820304393768, 'recall': 0.14884509146213531, 'f1': 0.16119760274887085}"", ""{'precision': 0.18676285445690155, 'recall': 0.2741827070713043, 'f1': 0.23135605454444885}"", ""{'precision': 0.01473683025687933, 'recall': 0.23198658227920532, 'f1': 0.1224624440073967}"", ""{'precision': 0.31424480676651, 'recall': 0.09978776425123215, 'f1': 0.2060675323009491}"", ""{'precision': -0.09696684777736664, 'recall': 0.08984457701444626, 'f1': -0.0036923084408044815}"", ""{'precision': 0.2577022612094879, 'recall': 0.20712047815322876, 'f1': 0.23353365063667297}"", ""{'precision': 0.04533824324607849, 'recall': 0.1415725201368332, 'f1': 0.09447082877159119}"", ""{'precision': 0.15169040858745575, 'recall': 0.21877674758434296, 'f1': 0.18633955717086792}"", ""{'precision': 0.09471594542264938, 'recall': 0.08893232047557831, 'f1': 0.09329762309789658}"", ""{'precision': 0.13611166179180145, 'recall': 0.09732230752706528, 'f1': 0.11807652562856674}"", ""{'precision': -0.1604962795972824, 'recall': 0.15840131044387817, 'f1': -0.00455790851265192}"", ""{'precision': 0.08433659374713898, 'recall': 0.07663544267416, 'f1': 0.08197701722383499}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1035056673507767, 0.0671608869518552, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2584050114622343, 0.3223659397724296, 0.138290599624506, 0.0, 0.1969509557508073, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0986639785766601, 0.0, 0.0018812325738725, 0.0822918270022972, 0.0246503920127183, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0802679530882732, 0.1523317510883013, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0576822277357025]","[3.9166666666666665, 3.636363636363636, 0.4736842105263157, 3.4285714285714284, 10.0, 4.285714285714286, 3.8, 2.5833333333333335, 1.3548387096774193, 0.8857142857142857, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7333333333333334, 2.4, 5.35, 11.0, 4.888888888888889, 2.9, 2.7142857142857144, 1.9642857142857144, 2.260869565217391, 2.0, 2.2857142857142856, 4.333333333333333, 2.060606060606061, 0.925925925925926, 5.0, 1.7666666666666666, 4.2727272727272725, 8.875, 1.5454545454545454]","[""{'precision': 0.018605075776576996, 'recall': 0.027676809579133987, 'f1': 0.024723809212446213}"", ""{'precision': 0.11408830434083939, 'recall': 0.12945179641246796, 'f1': 0.12318607419729233}"", ""{'precision': -0.044818583875894547, 'recall': 0.039317525923252106, 'f1': -0.0014776296447962523}"", ""{'precision': 0.28842395544052124, 'recall': 0.400706022977829, 'f1': 0.3450360596179962}"", ""{'precision': -0.05558670684695244, 'recall': 0.05271483585238457, 'f1': -0.00039977935375645757}"", ""{'precision': 0.16830281913280487, 'recall': 0.07726295292377472, 'f1': 0.12379739433526993}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.017596537247300148, 'recall': 0.0009918430587276816, 'f1': 0.010889396071434021}"", ""{'precision': 0.3915248215198517, 'recall': 0.3192733824253082, 'f1': 0.35619881749153137}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.22101496160030365, 'recall': 0.1334792971611023, 'f1': 0.17820799350738525}"", ""{'precision': 0.1150352880358696, 'recall': 0.19117280840873718, 'f1': 0.1541975736618042}"", ""{'precision': 0.40110504627227783, 'recall': 0.40135687589645386, 'f1': 0.4022037982940674}"", ""{'precision': -0.0658365860581398, 'recall': 0.0735541507601738, 'f1': 0.004498577211052179}"", ""{'precision': -0.07433929294347763, 'recall': -0.10522875189781189, 'f1': -0.08806341141462326}"", ""{'precision': 0.06748929619789124, 'recall': 0.10652444511651993, 'f1': 0.08841516077518463}"", ""{'precision': 0.3841123580932617, 'recall': 0.2892446517944336, 'f1': 0.3373279571533203}"", ""{'precision': 0.03829863667488098, 'recall': 0.039665237069129944, 'f1': 0.04054334759712219}"", ""{'precision': 0.0621151439845562, 'recall': 0.06140831857919693, 'f1': 0.06328627467155457}"", ""{'precision': 0.2234218567609787, 'recall': 0.2235700637102127, 'f1': 0.22475756704807281}"", ""{'precision': 0.09432080388069153, 'recall': 0.19741639494895935, 'f1': 0.14673668146133423}"", ""{'precision': 0.17018228769302368, 'recall': 0.17701993882656097, 'f1': 0.17494195699691772}"", ""{'precision': -0.05711100995540619, 'recall': 0.15987704694271088, 'f1': 0.05057244002819061}"", ""{'precision': 0.1795092225074768, 'recall': 0.22820739448070526, 'f1': 0.20503807067871094}"", ""{'precision': 0.17392954230308533, 'recall': 0.1660403460264206, 'f1': 0.17133016884326935}"", ""{'precision': 0.24478335678577423, 'recall': 0.23942787945270538, 'f1': 0.2433353066444397}"", ""{'precision': 0.051276274025440216, 'recall': 0.03819303587079048, 'f1': 0.04627799242734909}"", ""{'precision': 0.0014669972006231546, 'recall': 0.09220745414495468, 'f1': 0.04797528684139252}"", ""{'precision': -0.14923645555973053, 'recall': 0.13711276650428772, 'f1': -0.008572653867304325}"", ""{'precision': 0.06578033417463303, 'recall': 0.1044427752494812, 'f1': 0.08652433007955551}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use (with examples): ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Format your answer as follows: (Teaching Method) (Response) Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.280274337093472, 0.0595901505578131, 0.0634508564975691, 0.0, 0.1072481046120325, 0.2331032305449905, 0.1887971609447683, 0.4482468976384072, 0.218167631398606, 0.2372445311148961, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1737546155282429, 0.1121535111154828, 0.1455629308592705, 0.2691694521503486, 0.0387265856899321, 0.1543118895803178, 0.1429861229229596, 0.2223921435844164, 0.1244109327523227, 0.0, 0.1376201412853196, 0.0359484198870081, 0.0885679996609688, 0.1497610494494438]","[2.4166666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 1.7142857142857142, 1.8571428571428572, 2.142857142857143, 2.4, 1.5833333333333333, 0.8064516129032258, 0.3714285714285714, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 3.0, 1.8888888888888888, 1.7, 2.4285714285714284, 1.1071428571428572, 0.9130434782608696, 0.56, 1.4285714285714286, 0.7777777777777778, 0.8181818181818182, 1.2592592592592593, 1.8571428571428572, 0.5333333333333333, 2.090909090909091, 1.875, 0.9090909090909092]","[""{'precision': 0.13864237070083618, 'recall': 0.22377946972846985, 'f1': 0.18218955397605896}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.29420068860054016, 'recall': 0.45664507150650024, 'f1': 0.37520068883895874}"", ""{'precision': 0.13351726531982422, 'recall': 0.29529616236686707, 'f1': 0.21441839635372162}"", ""{'precision': 0.29231661558151245, 'recall': 0.2771975100040436, 'f1': 0.28590792417526245}"", ""{'precision': -0.16725677251815796, 'recall': -0.02978040836751461, 'f1': -0.09770578891038895}"", ""{'precision': 0.218782439827919, 'recall': 0.24108827114105225, 'f1': 0.2311628758907318}"", ""{'precision': 0.24765720963478088, 'recall': 0.2681216597557068, 'f1': 0.25907573103904724}"", ""{'precision': 0.17579273879528046, 'recall': 0.0702231302857399, 'f1': 0.12388003617525101}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.08622314035892487, 'recall': 0.32667577266693115, 'f1': 0.2049374133348465}"", ""{'precision': 0.25753599405288696, 'recall': 0.3161171078681946, 'f1': 0.2878223955631256}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.13379955291748047, 'recall': 0.09721406549215317, 'f1': 0.11687683314085007}"", ""{'precision': 0.015880854800343513, 'recall': 0.0830654427409172, 'f1': 0.05079316720366478}"", ""{'precision': 0.23008720576763153, 'recall': 0.4026769995689392, 'f1': 0.31608065962791443}"", ""{'precision': 0.296329528093338, 'recall': 0.46848103404045105, 'f1': 0.38202130794525146}"", ""{'precision': 0.12538881599903107, 'recall': 0.12354177236557007, 'f1': 0.12588776648044586}"", ""{'precision': 0.3607337772846222, 'recall': 0.31556951999664307, 'f1': 0.33912941813468933}"", ""{'precision': -0.07983797043561935, 'recall': 0.057360295206308365, 'f1': -0.010546828620135784}"", ""{'precision': 0.31597214937210083, 'recall': 0.2876557409763336, 'f1': 0.3029094934463501}"", ""{'precision': 0.09233592450618744, 'recall': 0.2008637934923172, 'f1': 0.14741015434265137}"", ""{'precision': 0.22945044934749603, 'recall': 0.2754858434200287, 'f1': 0.2535819411277771}"", ""{'precision': 0.1828542798757553, 'recall': 0.2094971388578415, 'f1': 0.19744791090488434}"", ""{'precision': 0.10266786813735962, 'recall': 0.19699440896511078, 'f1': 0.1507779061794281}"", ""{'precision': 0.10981395095586777, 'recall': 0.047144029289484024, 'f1': 0.07977928966283798}"", ""{'precision': 0.09698135405778885, 'recall': 0.290243923664093, 'f1': 0.1931089609861374}"", ""{'precision': 0.07298797369003296, 'recall': 0.2475324124097824, 'f1': 0.16013599932193756}"", ""{'precision': 0.09527769684791565, 'recall': 0.10083868354558945, 'f1': 0.09952209889888763}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.0602024057870188, 0.0369230996710913, 0.0334222354874107, 0.0, 0.0172822121316674, 0.2822177794147447, 0.1264396151914723, 0.4482468976384072, 0.2166361496557471, 0.2112315144141515, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1458772459155634, 0.0484547153022719, 0.0976198112765639, 0.1287198804729226, 0.0252047787261781, 0.0963881797449929, 0.0319340280246817, 0.2765885904901324, 0.0176132574100486, 0.0, 0.1542999093435335, 0.2538067443387491, 0.0, 0.1461071665346364]","[2.1666666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 2.7142857142857144, 1.7142857142857142, 2.142857142857143, 1.4, 1.3333333333333333, 0.3870967741935484, 0.6285714285714286, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 4.8, 1.5555555555555556, 2.7, 2.142857142857143, 0.6071428571428571, 1.608695652173913, 1.2, 1.7857142857142858, 1.1111111111111112, 0.4545454545454545, 1.4074074074074074, 3.2857142857142856, 0.5333333333333333, 1.3636363636363635, 5.125, 0.8181818181818182]","[""{'precision': 0.11144650727510452, 'recall': 0.16678740084171295, 'f1': 0.1403663456439972}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.16733106970787048, 'recall': 0.34498879313468933, 'f1': 0.2558545470237732}"", ""{'precision': 0.14777971804141998, 'recall': 0.12287995219230652, 'f1': 0.13670334219932556}"", ""{'precision': 0.14047302305698395, 'recall': 0.16943396627902985, 'f1': 0.15628546476364136}"", ""{'precision': -0.1741969883441925, 'recall': -0.2152625024318695, 'f1': -0.19287870824337006}"", ""{'precision': 0.10095961391925812, 'recall': -0.010690257884562016, 'f1': 0.04605867713689804}"", ""{'precision': 0.4403025507926941, 'recall': 0.15784242749214172, 'f1': 0.29640036821365356}"", ""{'precision': 0.1082160696387291, 'recall': -0.02357855811715126, 'f1': 0.043000295758247375}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.0672667920589447, 'recall': 0.34117069840431213, 'f1': 0.20187444984912872}"", ""{'precision': 0.21142058074474335, 'recall': 0.2578919529914856, 'f1': 0.23579636216163635}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.07662168145179749, 'recall': -0.05927005410194397, 'f1': 0.00935102254152298}"", ""{'precision': -0.02370366081595421, 'recall': -0.02631603181362152, 'f1': -0.02334471233189106}"", ""{'precision': 0.3802837133407593, 'recall': 0.37594321370124817, 'f1': 0.37912291288375854}"", ""{'precision': 0.22057241201400757, 'recall': 0.2892892360687256, 'f1': 0.25591564178466797}"", ""{'precision': 0.13475148379802704, 'recall': -0.040554143488407135, 'f1': 0.047102976590394974}"", ""{'precision': 0.2246946543455124, 'recall': 0.10567621141672134, 'f1': 0.16584555804729462}"", ""{'precision': -0.022776130586862564, 'recall': 0.083047054708004, 'f1': 0.031150298193097115}"", ""{'precision': 0.2631351351737976, 'recall': 0.2743387222290039, 'f1': 0.269919216632843}"", ""{'precision': -0.08870362490415573, 'recall': 0.10129321366548538, 'f1': 0.006090278271585703}"", ""{'precision': 0.42749470472335815, 'recall': 0.1397526115179062, 'f1': 0.28082096576690674}"", ""{'precision': 0.06014829874038696, 'recall': 0.12220893800258636, 'f1': 0.09246557205915451}"", ""{'precision': 0.2430046945810318, 'recall': 0.3270018994808197, 'f1': 0.2858295142650604}"", ""{'precision': 0.14836622774600983, 'recall': 0.00877873133867979, 'f1': 0.07909627258777618}"", ""{'precision': 0.2596312463283539, 'recall': 0.2833509147167206, 'f1': 0.2726484537124634}"", ""{'precision': -0.04212549328804016, 'recall': 0.2262428104877472, 'f1': 0.0899641290307045}"", ""{'precision': 0.13963252305984497, 'recall': 0.06494591385126114, 'f1': 0.10346974432468414}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  Directly answer the student's question.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.1387281377207149, 0.0326287712524776, 0.0931273669314074, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3685939814893283, 0.3223659397724296, 0.2835382546816534, 0.0353186986044697, 0.2098288242723427, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1303345371663271, 0.1411195762450153, 0.2307743706703186, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1447803716874165, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0144460941817118, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.0833333333333335, 1.6363636363636365, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7857142857142856, 5.142857142857143, 8.285714285714286, 3.8, 3.6666666666666665, 0.7741935483870968, 0.8857142857142857, 1.2105263157894737, 2.0, 2.3333333333333335, 2.75, 6.8, 6.888888888888889, 3.7, 5.571428571428571, 0.9642857142857144, 1.6521739130434785, 0.92, 3.2857142857142856, 5.111111111111111, 1.4848484848484849, 2.2222222222222223, 4.571428571428571, 1.3666666666666667, 2.727272727272727, 8.75, 2.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.11432495713233948, 'recall': 0.03324726223945618, 'f1': 0.07496145367622375}"", ""{'precision': 0.34705960750579834, 'recall': 0.16323672235012054, 'f1': 0.2547290027141571}"", ""{'precision': -0.04055697098374367, 'recall': 0.13544459640979767, 'f1': 0.047443777322769165}"", ""{'precision': 0.2874433696269989, 'recall': 0.3909418284893036, 'f1': 0.33976122736930847}"", ""{'precision': 0.013704590499401093, 'recall': 0.1261105239391327, 'f1': 0.07079096138477325}"", ""{'precision': 0.0022958312183618546, 'recall': 0.0070695350877940655, 'f1': 0.006298996973782778}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.04759303852915764, 'recall': 0.14297078549861908, 'f1': 0.09630267322063446}"", ""{'precision': 0.5061132907867432, 'recall': 0.3179398477077484, 'f1': 0.4113249182701111}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.3297567069530487, 'recall': 0.20683324337005615, 'f1': 0.268756240606308}"", ""{'precision': 0.0749378353357315, 'recall': 0.11573436856269836, 'f1': 0.09672435373067856}"", ""{'precision': 0.4073179364204407, 'recall': 0.39869120717048645, 'f1': 0.4039713740348816}"", ""{'precision': -0.009095241315662861, 'recall': 0.020507877692580223, 'f1': 0.007277961820363998}"", ""{'precision': -0.06473217904567719, 'recall': -0.034142181277275085, 'f1': -0.047779280692338943}"", ""{'precision': -0.04261331260204315, 'recall': 0.1446707844734192, 'f1': 0.050818946212530136}"", ""{'precision': 0.3305618166923523, 'recall': 0.26773256063461304, 'f1': 0.30009621381759644}"", ""{'precision': -0.031261153519153595, 'recall': 0.018836529925465584, 'f1': -0.004703410901129246}"", ""{'precision': 0.15156836807727814, 'recall': 0.07251915335655212, 'f1': 0.11317533999681473}"", ""{'precision': 0.22911085188388824, 'recall': 0.17426548898220062, 'f1': 0.20283786952495575}"", ""{'precision': 0.24250556528568268, 'recall': 0.2621985375881195, 'f1': 0.2535487413406372}"", ""{'precision': 0.19026708602905273, 'recall': 0.1819763332605362, 'f1': 0.18744036555290222}"", ""{'precision': -0.07508712261915207, 'recall': 0.037153083831071854, 'f1': -0.017948396503925323}"", ""{'precision': 0.2166709154844284, 'recall': 0.17746104300022125, 'f1': 0.19829514622688293}"", ""{'precision': 0.07609530538320541, 'recall': 0.12819607555866241, 'f1': 0.10347115993499756}"", ""{'precision': 0.23566016554832458, 'recall': 0.2002030313014984, 'f1': 0.2191401720046997}"", ""{'precision': 0.039474498480558395, 'recall': 0.03034212253987789, 'f1': 0.03647209703922272}"", ""{'precision': 0.17368051409721375, 'recall': 0.15962590277194977, 'f1': 0.16799703240394592}"", ""{'precision': -0.06723884493112564, 'recall': 0.22073249518871307, 'f1': 0.07412375509738922}"", ""{'precision': 0.13290952146053314, 'recall': 0.07355167716741562, 'f1': 0.1045115739107132}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1231552158867506, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1595867466221573, 0.2816988029230364, 0.0375123027908174, 0.0, 0.121658365925153, 0.0026883850904072, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1601171066931316, 0.0, 0.118127981268613, 0.023413470249148, 0.1743353397675923, 0.017465844953817, 0.0, 0.1669695384489661, 0.1627683104536919, 0.0, 0.0606433872310888, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.1666666666666665, 3.8181818181818183, 1.105263157894737, 4.357142857142857, 8.142857142857142, 8.285714285714286, 6.2, 3.6666666666666665, 1.903225806451613, 1.0285714285714285, 2.5789473684210527, 4.0, 2.8666666666666667, 2.15, 5.8, 4.333333333333333, 2.3, 6.714285714285714, 1.5357142857142858, 2.869565217391304, 1.24, 2.0714285714285716, 3.111111111111111, 1.5454545454545454, 1.037037037037037, 4.714285714285714, 1.2666666666666666, 2.4545454545454546, 2.25, 3.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.10684812068939209, 'recall': 0.03631405159831047, 'f1': 0.07283965498209}"", ""{'precision': 0.18081633746623993, 'recall': 0.21930274367332458, 'f1': 0.20128819346427917}"", ""{'precision': 0.17166095972061157, 'recall': 0.13189461827278137, 'f1': 0.15307734906673431}"", ""{'precision': 0.2035761922597885, 'recall': 0.36162516474723816, 'f1': 0.28257477283477783}"", ""{'precision': -0.007911596447229385, 'recall': 0.07360721379518509, 'f1': 0.03408719226717949}"", ""{'precision': -0.029209056869149208, 'recall': -0.0254511758685112, 'f1': -0.025661807507276535}"", ""{'precision': -0.28529930114746094, 'recall': -0.1471974402666092, 'f1': -0.21527764201164246}"", ""{'precision': 0.06908895075321198, 'recall': 0.19120818376541138, 'f1': 0.1308295577764511}"", ""{'precision': 0.24328982830047607, 'recall': 0.3773156702518463, 'f1': 0.3105713427066803}"", ""{'precision': 0.37962114810943604, 'recall': 0.23239125311374664, 'f1': 0.30609819293022156}"", ""{'precision': 0.14460481703281403, 'recall': 0.2137676626443863, 'f1': 0.18028776347637177}"", ""{'precision': 0.054828621447086334, 'recall': 0.1578940600156784, 'f1': 0.10728989541530609}"", ""{'precision': 0.3231819272041321, 'recall': 0.42914193868637085, 'f1': 0.3766500651836395}"", ""{'precision': 0.06238151714205742, 'recall': 0.07595311105251312, 'f1': 0.07067088782787323}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.040648944675922394, 'recall': 0.0014439028454944491, 'f1': 0.02255857363343239}"", ""{'precision': 0.33503711223602295, 'recall': 0.3662688434123993, 'f1': 0.3516627848148346}"", ""{'precision': -0.0808199793100357, 'recall': 0.04339419677853584, 'f1': -0.017838211730122566}"", ""{'precision': 0.17228850722312927, 'recall': 0.16112887859344482, 'f1': 0.16805635392665863}"", ""{'precision': 0.16065724194049835, 'recall': 0.2842628061771393, 'f1': 0.22298717498779297}"", ""{'precision': 0.19424818456172943, 'recall': 0.25405827164649963, 'f1': 0.22524210810661316}"", ""{'precision': 0.20658765733242035, 'recall': 0.1472964882850647, 'f1': 0.17810629308223724}"", ""{'precision': 0.02119770273566246, 'recall': 0.08223419636487961, 'f1': 0.0530717670917511}"", ""{'precision': 0.3092431426048279, 'recall': 0.23614603281021118, 'f1': 0.273618221282959}"", ""{'precision': 0.15373331308364868, 'recall': 0.1726284623146057, 'f1': 0.16452297568321228}"", ""{'precision': 0.1746618002653122, 'recall': 0.22373667359352112, 'f1': 0.20038409531116486}"", ""{'precision': 0.08880196511745453, 'recall': 0.07461851090192795, 'f1': 0.08319153636693954}"", ""{'precision': 0.1476742923259735, 'recall': 0.07884303480386734, 'f1': 0.11446332186460495}"", ""{'precision': -0.23309831321239471, 'recall': 0.09990908950567245, 'f1': -0.07053916156291962}"", ""{'precision': 0.03019283153116703, 'recall': 0.08091480284929276, 'f1': 0.05696043372154236}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.01413928988305, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.232914392851028, 0.288552621816469, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0777051775670442, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1016052632718472, 0.0, 0.1037397015701301, 0.0456987312059718, 0.0722312220036983, 0.1387480518647602, 0.0, 0.1161288667856411, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0851336600337967, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[5.666666666666667, 2.636363636363636, 2.789473684210526, 3.928571428571429, 6.714285714285714, 6.142857142857143, 7.0, 4.25, 1.4838709677419355, 1.0285714285714285, 2.789473684210526, 3.4, 3.0, 4.9, 5.8, 6.111111111111111, 2.5, 5.142857142857143, 1.5357142857142858, 2.652173913043478, 1.64, 1.1428571428571428, 6.888888888888889, 1.8484848484848484, 3.0, 5.714285714285714, 1.1, 2.909090909090909, 5.125, 2.6818181818181817]","[""{'precision': -0.09311841428279877, 'recall': -0.01294065173715353, 'f1': -0.051645345985889435}"", ""{'precision': 0.2109493762254715, 'recall': 0.20667512714862823, 'f1': 0.21009676158428192}"", ""{'precision': -0.02898159623146057, 'recall': 0.15586157143115997, 'f1': 0.0632597804069519}"", ""{'precision': 0.25616416335105896, 'recall': 0.3921296298503876, 'f1': 0.32437044382095337}"", ""{'precision': -0.03161277994513512, 'recall': 0.057851266115903854, 'f1': 0.014321071095764637}"", ""{'precision': -0.03530910238623619, 'recall': 0.05106435716152191, 'f1': 0.009115110151469707}"", ""{'precision': -0.35257774591445923, 'recall': -0.09080387651920319, 'f1': -0.22332797944545746}"", ""{'precision': 0.01716284081339836, 'recall': 0.16772548854351044, 'f1': 0.09279683977365494}"", ""{'precision': 0.3477271497249603, 'recall': 0.3651588559150696, 'f1': 0.35747477412223816}"", ""{'precision': 0.4063907563686371, 'recall': 0.23384788632392883, 'f1': 0.3198058307170868}"", ""{'precision': 0.09873276203870773, 'recall': 0.18228335678577423, 'f1': 0.14156284928321838}"", ""{'precision': 0.09469754993915558, 'recall': 0.19298988580703735, 'f1': 0.14476250112056732}"", ""{'precision': 0.32154300808906555, 'recall': 0.36767488718032837, 'f1': 0.345574289560318}"", ""{'precision': -0.08242210745811462, 'recall': 0.07026062160730362, 'f1': -0.005622691474854946}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.0636489987373352, 'recall': 0.29298919439315796, 'f1': 0.17709165811538696}"", ""{'precision': 0.32472991943359375, 'recall': 0.4210628569126129, 'f1': 0.37348079681396484}"", ""{'precision': 0.011358527466654778, 'recall': 0.052887097001075745, 'f1': 0.03360971808433533}"", ""{'precision': 0.17086820304393768, 'recall': 0.14884509146213531, 'f1': 0.16119760274887085}"", ""{'precision': 0.18676285445690155, 'recall': 0.2741827070713043, 'f1': 0.23135605454444885}"", ""{'precision': 0.01473683025687933, 'recall': 0.23198658227920532, 'f1': 0.1224624440073967}"", ""{'precision': 0.31424480676651, 'recall': 0.09978776425123215, 'f1': 0.2060675323009491}"", ""{'precision': -0.09696684777736664, 'recall': 0.08984457701444626, 'f1': -0.0036923084408044815}"", ""{'precision': 0.2577022612094879, 'recall': 0.20712047815322876, 'f1': 0.23353365063667297}"", ""{'precision': 0.04533824324607849, 'recall': 0.1415725201368332, 'f1': 0.09447082877159119}"", ""{'precision': 0.15169040858745575, 'recall': 0.21877674758434296, 'f1': 0.18633955717086792}"", ""{'precision': 0.09471594542264938, 'recall': 0.08893232047557831, 'f1': 0.09329762309789658}"", ""{'precision': 0.13611166179180145, 'recall': 0.09732230752706528, 'f1': 0.11807652562856674}"", ""{'precision': -0.1604962795972824, 'recall': 0.15840131044387817, 'f1': -0.00455790851265192}"", ""{'precision': 0.08433659374713898, 'recall': 0.07663544267416, 'f1': 0.08197701722383499}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1035056673507767, 0.0671608869518552, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2584050114622343, 0.3223659397724296, 0.138290599624506, 0.0, 0.1969509557508073, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0986639785766601, 0.0, 0.0018812325738725, 0.0822918270022972, 0.0246503920127183, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0802679530882732, 0.1523317510883013, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0576822277357025]","[3.9166666666666665, 3.636363636363636, 0.4736842105263157, 3.4285714285714284, 10.0, 4.285714285714286, 3.8, 2.5833333333333335, 1.3548387096774193, 0.8857142857142857, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7333333333333334, 2.4, 5.35, 11.0, 4.888888888888889, 2.9, 2.7142857142857144, 1.9642857142857144, 2.260869565217391, 2.0, 2.2857142857142856, 4.333333333333333, 2.060606060606061, 0.925925925925926, 5.0, 1.7666666666666666, 4.2727272727272725, 8.875, 1.5454545454545454]","[""{'precision': 0.018605075776576996, 'recall': 0.027676809579133987, 'f1': 0.024723809212446213}"", ""{'precision': 0.11408830434083939, 'recall': 0.12945179641246796, 'f1': 0.12318607419729233}"", ""{'precision': -0.044818583875894547, 'recall': 0.039317525923252106, 'f1': -0.0014776296447962523}"", ""{'precision': 0.28842395544052124, 'recall': 0.400706022977829, 'f1': 0.3450360596179962}"", ""{'precision': -0.05558670684695244, 'recall': 0.05271483585238457, 'f1': -0.00039977935375645757}"", ""{'precision': 0.16830281913280487, 'recall': 0.07726295292377472, 'f1': 0.12379739433526993}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.017596537247300148, 'recall': 0.0009918430587276816, 'f1': 0.010889396071434021}"", ""{'precision': 0.3915248215198517, 'recall': 0.3192733824253082, 'f1': 0.35619881749153137}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.22101496160030365, 'recall': 0.1334792971611023, 'f1': 0.17820799350738525}"", ""{'precision': 0.1150352880358696, 'recall': 0.19117280840873718, 'f1': 0.1541975736618042}"", ""{'precision': 0.40110504627227783, 'recall': 0.40135687589645386, 'f1': 0.4022037982940674}"", ""{'precision': -0.0658365860581398, 'recall': 0.0735541507601738, 'f1': 0.004498577211052179}"", ""{'precision': -0.07433929294347763, 'recall': -0.10522875189781189, 'f1': -0.08806341141462326}"", ""{'precision': 0.06748929619789124, 'recall': 0.10652444511651993, 'f1': 0.08841516077518463}"", ""{'precision': 0.3841123580932617, 'recall': 0.2892446517944336, 'f1': 0.3373279571533203}"", ""{'precision': 0.03829863667488098, 'recall': 0.039665237069129944, 'f1': 0.04054334759712219}"", ""{'precision': 0.0621151439845562, 'recall': 0.06140831857919693, 'f1': 0.06328627467155457}"", ""{'precision': 0.2234218567609787, 'recall': 0.2235700637102127, 'f1': 0.22475756704807281}"", ""{'precision': 0.09432080388069153, 'recall': 0.19741639494895935, 'f1': 0.14673668146133423}"", ""{'precision': 0.17018228769302368, 'recall': 0.17701993882656097, 'f1': 0.17494195699691772}"", ""{'precision': -0.05711100995540619, 'recall': 0.15987704694271088, 'f1': 0.05057244002819061}"", ""{'precision': 0.1795092225074768, 'recall': 0.22820739448070526, 'f1': 0.20503807067871094}"", ""{'precision': 0.17392954230308533, 'recall': 0.1660403460264206, 'f1': 0.17133016884326935}"", ""{'precision': 0.24478335678577423, 'recall': 0.23942787945270538, 'f1': 0.2433353066444397}"", ""{'precision': 0.051276274025440216, 'recall': 0.03819303587079048, 'f1': 0.04627799242734909}"", ""{'precision': 0.0014669972006231546, 'recall': 0.09220745414495468, 'f1': 0.04797528684139252}"", ""{'precision': -0.14923645555973053, 'recall': 0.13711276650428772, 'f1': -0.008572653867304325}"", ""{'precision': 0.06578033417463303, 'recall': 0.1044427752494812, 'f1': 0.08652433007955551}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use (with examples): ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Format your answer as follows: (Teaching Method) (Response) Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.280274337093472, 0.0595901505578131, 0.0634508564975691, 0.0, 0.1072481046120325, 0.2331032305449905, 0.1887971609447683, 0.4482468976384072, 0.218167631398606, 0.2372445311148961, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1737546155282429, 0.1121535111154828, 0.1455629308592705, 0.2691694521503486, 0.0387265856899321, 0.1543118895803178, 0.1429861229229596, 0.2223921435844164, 0.1244109327523227, 0.0, 0.1376201412853196, 0.0359484198870081, 0.0885679996609688, 0.1497610494494438]","[2.4166666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 1.7142857142857142, 1.8571428571428572, 2.142857142857143, 2.4, 1.5833333333333333, 0.8064516129032258, 0.3714285714285714, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 3.0, 1.8888888888888888, 1.7, 2.4285714285714284, 1.1071428571428572, 0.9130434782608696, 0.56, 1.4285714285714286, 0.7777777777777778, 0.8181818181818182, 1.2592592592592593, 1.8571428571428572, 0.5333333333333333, 2.090909090909091, 1.875, 0.9090909090909092]","[""{'precision': 0.13864237070083618, 'recall': 0.22377946972846985, 'f1': 0.18218955397605896}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.29420068860054016, 'recall': 0.45664507150650024, 'f1': 0.37520068883895874}"", ""{'precision': 0.13351726531982422, 'recall': 0.29529616236686707, 'f1': 0.21441839635372162}"", ""{'precision': 0.29231661558151245, 'recall': 0.2771975100040436, 'f1': 0.28590792417526245}"", ""{'precision': -0.16725677251815796, 'recall': -0.02978040836751461, 'f1': -0.09770578891038895}"", ""{'precision': 0.218782439827919, 'recall': 0.24108827114105225, 'f1': 0.2311628758907318}"", ""{'precision': 0.24765720963478088, 'recall': 0.2681216597557068, 'f1': 0.25907573103904724}"", ""{'precision': 0.17579273879528046, 'recall': 0.0702231302857399, 'f1': 0.12388003617525101}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.08622314035892487, 'recall': 0.32667577266693115, 'f1': 0.2049374133348465}"", ""{'precision': 0.25753599405288696, 'recall': 0.3161171078681946, 'f1': 0.2878223955631256}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.13379955291748047, 'recall': 0.09721406549215317, 'f1': 0.11687683314085007}"", ""{'precision': 0.015880854800343513, 'recall': 0.0830654427409172, 'f1': 0.05079316720366478}"", ""{'precision': 0.23008720576763153, 'recall': 0.4026769995689392, 'f1': 0.31608065962791443}"", ""{'precision': 0.296329528093338, 'recall': 0.46848103404045105, 'f1': 0.38202130794525146}"", ""{'precision': 0.12538881599903107, 'recall': 0.12354177236557007, 'f1': 0.12588776648044586}"", ""{'precision': 0.3607337772846222, 'recall': 0.31556951999664307, 'f1': 0.33912941813468933}"", ""{'precision': -0.07983797043561935, 'recall': 0.057360295206308365, 'f1': -0.010546828620135784}"", ""{'precision': 0.31597214937210083, 'recall': 0.2876557409763336, 'f1': 0.3029094934463501}"", ""{'precision': 0.09233592450618744, 'recall': 0.2008637934923172, 'f1': 0.14741015434265137}"", ""{'precision': 0.22945044934749603, 'recall': 0.2754858434200287, 'f1': 0.2535819411277771}"", ""{'precision': 0.1828542798757553, 'recall': 0.2094971388578415, 'f1': 0.19744791090488434}"", ""{'precision': 0.10266786813735962, 'recall': 0.19699440896511078, 'f1': 0.1507779061794281}"", ""{'precision': 0.10981395095586777, 'recall': 0.047144029289484024, 'f1': 0.07977928966283798}"", ""{'precision': 0.09698135405778885, 'recall': 0.290243923664093, 'f1': 0.1931089609861374}"", ""{'precision': 0.07298797369003296, 'recall': 0.2475324124097824, 'f1': 0.16013599932193756}"", ""{'precision': 0.09527769684791565, 'recall': 0.10083868354558945, 'f1': 0.09952209889888763}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.0602024057870188, 0.0369230996710913, 0.0334222354874107, 0.0, 0.0172822121316674, 0.2822177794147447, 0.1264396151914723, 0.4482468976384072, 0.2166361496557471, 0.2112315144141515, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1458772459155634, 0.0484547153022719, 0.0976198112765639, 0.1287198804729226, 0.0252047787261781, 0.0963881797449929, 0.0319340280246817, 0.2765885904901324, 0.0176132574100486, 0.0, 0.1542999093435335, 0.2538067443387491, 0.0, 0.1461071665346364]","[2.1666666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 2.7142857142857144, 1.7142857142857142, 2.142857142857143, 1.4, 1.3333333333333333, 0.3870967741935484, 0.6285714285714286, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 4.8, 1.5555555555555556, 2.7, 2.142857142857143, 0.6071428571428571, 1.608695652173913, 1.2, 1.7857142857142858, 1.1111111111111112, 0.4545454545454545, 1.4074074074074074, 3.2857142857142856, 0.5333333333333333, 1.3636363636363635, 5.125, 0.8181818181818182]","[""{'precision': 0.11144650727510452, 'recall': 0.16678740084171295, 'f1': 0.1403663456439972}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.16733106970787048, 'recall': 0.34498879313468933, 'f1': 0.2558545470237732}"", ""{'precision': 0.14777971804141998, 'recall': 0.12287995219230652, 'f1': 0.13670334219932556}"", ""{'precision': 0.14047302305698395, 'recall': 0.16943396627902985, 'f1': 0.15628546476364136}"", ""{'precision': -0.1741969883441925, 'recall': -0.2152625024318695, 'f1': -0.19287870824337006}"", ""{'precision': 0.10095961391925812, 'recall': -0.010690257884562016, 'f1': 0.04605867713689804}"", ""{'precision': 0.4403025507926941, 'recall': 0.15784242749214172, 'f1': 0.29640036821365356}"", ""{'precision': 0.1082160696387291, 'recall': -0.02357855811715126, 'f1': 0.043000295758247375}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.0672667920589447, 'recall': 0.34117069840431213, 'f1': 0.20187444984912872}"", ""{'precision': 0.21142058074474335, 'recall': 0.2578919529914856, 'f1': 0.23579636216163635}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.07662168145179749, 'recall': -0.05927005410194397, 'f1': 0.00935102254152298}"", ""{'precision': -0.02370366081595421, 'recall': -0.02631603181362152, 'f1': -0.02334471233189106}"", ""{'precision': 0.3802837133407593, 'recall': 0.37594321370124817, 'f1': 0.37912291288375854}"", ""{'precision': 0.22057241201400757, 'recall': 0.2892892360687256, 'f1': 0.25591564178466797}"", ""{'precision': 0.13475148379802704, 'recall': -0.040554143488407135, 'f1': 0.047102976590394974}"", ""{'precision': 0.2246946543455124, 'recall': 0.10567621141672134, 'f1': 0.16584555804729462}"", ""{'precision': -0.022776130586862564, 'recall': 0.083047054708004, 'f1': 0.031150298193097115}"", ""{'precision': 0.2631351351737976, 'recall': 0.2743387222290039, 'f1': 0.269919216632843}"", ""{'precision': -0.08870362490415573, 'recall': 0.10129321366548538, 'f1': 0.006090278271585703}"", ""{'precision': 0.42749470472335815, 'recall': 0.1397526115179062, 'f1': 0.28082096576690674}"", ""{'precision': 0.06014829874038696, 'recall': 0.12220893800258636, 'f1': 0.09246557205915451}"", ""{'precision': 0.2430046945810318, 'recall': 0.3270018994808197, 'f1': 0.2858295142650604}"", ""{'precision': 0.14836622774600983, 'recall': 0.00877873133867979, 'f1': 0.07909627258777618}"", ""{'precision': 0.2596312463283539, 'recall': 0.2833509147167206, 'f1': 0.2726484537124634}"", ""{'precision': -0.04212549328804016, 'recall': 0.2262428104877472, 'f1': 0.0899641290307045}"", ""{'precision': 0.13963252305984497, 'recall': 0.06494591385126114, 'f1': 0.10346974432468414}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  Directly answer the student's question.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.1387281377207149, 0.0326287712524776, 0.0931273669314074, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3685939814893283, 0.3223659397724296, 0.2835382546816534, 0.0353186986044697, 0.2098288242723427, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1303345371663271, 0.1411195762450153, 0.2307743706703186, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1447803716874165, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0144460941817118, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.0833333333333335, 1.6363636363636365, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7857142857142856, 5.142857142857143, 8.285714285714286, 3.8, 3.6666666666666665, 0.7741935483870968, 0.8857142857142857, 1.2105263157894737, 2.0, 2.3333333333333335, 2.75, 6.8, 6.888888888888889, 3.7, 5.571428571428571, 0.9642857142857144, 1.6521739130434785, 0.92, 3.2857142857142856, 5.111111111111111, 1.4848484848484849, 2.2222222222222223, 4.571428571428571, 1.3666666666666667, 2.727272727272727, 8.75, 2.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.11432495713233948, 'recall': 0.03324726223945618, 'f1': 0.07496145367622375}"", ""{'precision': 0.34705960750579834, 'recall': 0.16323672235012054, 'f1': 0.2547290027141571}"", ""{'precision': -0.04055697098374367, 'recall': 0.13544459640979767, 'f1': 0.047443777322769165}"", ""{'precision': 0.2874433696269989, 'recall': 0.3909418284893036, 'f1': 0.33976122736930847}"", ""{'precision': 0.013704590499401093, 'recall': 0.1261105239391327, 'f1': 0.07079096138477325}"", ""{'precision': 0.0022958312183618546, 'recall': 0.0070695350877940655, 'f1': 0.006298996973782778}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.04759303852915764, 'recall': 0.14297078549861908, 'f1': 0.09630267322063446}"", ""{'precision': 0.5061132907867432, 'recall': 0.3179398477077484, 'f1': 0.4113249182701111}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.3297567069530487, 'recall': 0.20683324337005615, 'f1': 0.268756240606308}"", ""{'precision': 0.0749378353357315, 'recall': 0.11573436856269836, 'f1': 0.09672435373067856}"", ""{'precision': 0.4073179364204407, 'recall': 0.39869120717048645, 'f1': 0.4039713740348816}"", ""{'precision': -0.009095241315662861, 'recall': 0.020507877692580223, 'f1': 0.007277961820363998}"", ""{'precision': -0.06473217904567719, 'recall': -0.034142181277275085, 'f1': -0.047779280692338943}"", ""{'precision': -0.04261331260204315, 'recall': 0.1446707844734192, 'f1': 0.050818946212530136}"", ""{'precision': 0.3305618166923523, 'recall': 0.26773256063461304, 'f1': 0.30009621381759644}"", ""{'precision': -0.031261153519153595, 'recall': 0.018836529925465584, 'f1': -0.004703410901129246}"", ""{'precision': 0.15156836807727814, 'recall': 0.07251915335655212, 'f1': 0.11317533999681473}"", ""{'precision': 0.22911085188388824, 'recall': 0.17426548898220062, 'f1': 0.20283786952495575}"", ""{'precision': 0.24250556528568268, 'recall': 0.2621985375881195, 'f1': 0.2535487413406372}"", ""{'precision': 0.19026708602905273, 'recall': 0.1819763332605362, 'f1': 0.18744036555290222}"", ""{'precision': -0.07508712261915207, 'recall': 0.037153083831071854, 'f1': -0.017948396503925323}"", ""{'precision': 0.2166709154844284, 'recall': 0.17746104300022125, 'f1': 0.19829514622688293}"", ""{'precision': 0.07609530538320541, 'recall': 0.12819607555866241, 'f1': 0.10347115993499756}"", ""{'precision': 0.23566016554832458, 'recall': 0.2002030313014984, 'f1': 0.2191401720046997}"", ""{'precision': 0.039474498480558395, 'recall': 0.03034212253987789, 'f1': 0.03647209703922272}"", ""{'precision': 0.17368051409721375, 'recall': 0.15962590277194977, 'f1': 0.16799703240394592}"", ""{'precision': -0.06723884493112564, 'recall': 0.22073249518871307, 'f1': 0.07412375509738922}"", ""{'precision': 0.13290952146053314, 'recall': 0.07355167716741562, 'f1': 0.1045115739107132}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1231552158867506, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1595867466221573, 0.2816988029230364, 0.0375123027908174, 0.0, 0.121658365925153, 0.0026883850904072, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1601171066931316, 0.0, 0.118127981268613, 0.023413470249148, 0.1743353397675923, 0.017465844953817, 0.0, 0.1669695384489661, 0.1627683104536919, 0.0, 0.0606433872310888, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.1666666666666665, 3.8181818181818183, 1.105263157894737, 4.357142857142857, 8.142857142857142, 8.285714285714286, 6.2, 3.6666666666666665, 1.903225806451613, 1.0285714285714285, 2.5789473684210527, 4.0, 2.8666666666666667, 2.15, 5.8, 4.333333333333333, 2.3, 6.714285714285714, 1.5357142857142858, 2.869565217391304, 1.24, 2.0714285714285716, 3.111111111111111, 1.5454545454545454, 1.037037037037037, 4.714285714285714, 1.2666666666666666, 2.4545454545454546, 2.25, 3.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.10684812068939209, 'recall': 0.03631405159831047, 'f1': 0.07283965498209}"", ""{'precision': 0.18081633746623993, 'recall': 0.21930274367332458, 'f1': 0.20128819346427917}"", ""{'precision': 0.17166095972061157, 'recall': 0.13189461827278137, 'f1': 0.15307734906673431}"", ""{'precision': 0.2035761922597885, 'recall': 0.36162516474723816, 'f1': 0.28257477283477783}"", ""{'precision': -0.007911596447229385, 'recall': 0.07360721379518509, 'f1': 0.03408719226717949}"", ""{'precision': -0.029209056869149208, 'recall': -0.0254511758685112, 'f1': -0.025661807507276535}"", ""{'precision': -0.28529930114746094, 'recall': -0.1471974402666092, 'f1': -0.21527764201164246}"", ""{'precision': 0.06908895075321198, 'recall': 0.19120818376541138, 'f1': 0.1308295577764511}"", ""{'precision': 0.24328982830047607, 'recall': 0.3773156702518463, 'f1': 0.3105713427066803}"", ""{'precision': 0.37962114810943604, 'recall': 0.23239125311374664, 'f1': 0.30609819293022156}"", ""{'precision': 0.14460481703281403, 'recall': 0.2137676626443863, 'f1': 0.18028776347637177}"", ""{'precision': 0.054828621447086334, 'recall': 0.1578940600156784, 'f1': 0.10728989541530609}"", ""{'precision': 0.3231819272041321, 'recall': 0.42914193868637085, 'f1': 0.3766500651836395}"", ""{'precision': 0.06238151714205742, 'recall': 0.07595311105251312, 'f1': 0.07067088782787323}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.040648944675922394, 'recall': 0.0014439028454944491, 'f1': 0.02255857363343239}"", ""{'precision': 0.33503711223602295, 'recall': 0.3662688434123993, 'f1': 0.3516627848148346}"", ""{'precision': -0.0808199793100357, 'recall': 0.04339419677853584, 'f1': -0.017838211730122566}"", ""{'precision': 0.17228850722312927, 'recall': 0.16112887859344482, 'f1': 0.16805635392665863}"", ""{'precision': 0.16065724194049835, 'recall': 0.2842628061771393, 'f1': 0.22298717498779297}"", ""{'precision': 0.19424818456172943, 'recall': 0.25405827164649963, 'f1': 0.22524210810661316}"", ""{'precision': 0.20658765733242035, 'recall': 0.1472964882850647, 'f1': 0.17810629308223724}"", ""{'precision': 0.02119770273566246, 'recall': 0.08223419636487961, 'f1': 0.0530717670917511}"", ""{'precision': 0.3092431426048279, 'recall': 0.23614603281021118, 'f1': 0.273618221282959}"", ""{'precision': 0.15373331308364868, 'recall': 0.1726284623146057, 'f1': 0.16452297568321228}"", ""{'precision': 0.1746618002653122, 'recall': 0.22373667359352112, 'f1': 0.20038409531116486}"", ""{'precision': 0.08880196511745453, 'recall': 0.07461851090192795, 'f1': 0.08319153636693954}"", ""{'precision': 0.1476742923259735, 'recall': 0.07884303480386734, 'f1': 0.11446332186460495}"", ""{'precision': -0.23309831321239471, 'recall': 0.09990908950567245, 'f1': -0.07053916156291962}"", ""{'precision': 0.03019283153116703, 'recall': 0.08091480284929276, 'f1': 0.05696043372154236}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.01413928988305, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.232914392851028, 0.288552621816469, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0777051775670442, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1016052632718472, 0.0, 0.1037397015701301, 0.0456987312059718, 0.0722312220036983, 0.1387480518647602, 0.0, 0.1161288667856411, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0851336600337967, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[5.666666666666667, 2.636363636363636, 2.789473684210526, 3.928571428571429, 6.714285714285714, 6.142857142857143, 7.0, 4.25, 1.4838709677419355, 1.0285714285714285, 2.789473684210526, 3.4, 3.0, 4.9, 5.8, 6.111111111111111, 2.5, 5.142857142857143, 1.5357142857142858, 2.652173913043478, 1.64, 1.1428571428571428, 6.888888888888889, 1.8484848484848484, 3.0, 5.714285714285714, 1.1, 2.909090909090909, 5.125, 2.6818181818181817]","[""{'precision': -0.09311841428279877, 'recall': -0.01294065173715353, 'f1': -0.051645345985889435}"", ""{'precision': 0.2109493762254715, 'recall': 0.20667512714862823, 'f1': 0.21009676158428192}"", ""{'precision': -0.02898159623146057, 'recall': 0.15586157143115997, 'f1': 0.0632597804069519}"", ""{'precision': 0.25616416335105896, 'recall': 0.3921296298503876, 'f1': 0.32437044382095337}"", ""{'precision': -0.03161277994513512, 'recall': 0.057851266115903854, 'f1': 0.014321071095764637}"", ""{'precision': -0.03530910238623619, 'recall': 0.05106435716152191, 'f1': 0.009115110151469707}"", ""{'precision': -0.35257774591445923, 'recall': -0.09080387651920319, 'f1': -0.22332797944545746}"", ""{'precision': 0.01716284081339836, 'recall': 0.16772548854351044, 'f1': 0.09279683977365494}"", ""{'precision': 0.3477271497249603, 'recall': 0.3651588559150696, 'f1': 0.35747477412223816}"", ""{'precision': 0.4063907563686371, 'recall': 0.23384788632392883, 'f1': 0.3198058307170868}"", ""{'precision': 0.09873276203870773, 'recall': 0.18228335678577423, 'f1': 0.14156284928321838}"", ""{'precision': 0.09469754993915558, 'recall': 0.19298988580703735, 'f1': 0.14476250112056732}"", ""{'precision': 0.32154300808906555, 'recall': 0.36767488718032837, 'f1': 0.345574289560318}"", ""{'precision': -0.08242210745811462, 'recall': 0.07026062160730362, 'f1': -0.005622691474854946}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.0636489987373352, 'recall': 0.29298919439315796, 'f1': 0.17709165811538696}"", ""{'precision': 0.32472991943359375, 'recall': 0.4210628569126129, 'f1': 0.37348079681396484}"", ""{'precision': 0.011358527466654778, 'recall': 0.052887097001075745, 'f1': 0.03360971808433533}"", ""{'precision': 0.17086820304393768, 'recall': 0.14884509146213531, 'f1': 0.16119760274887085}"", ""{'precision': 0.18676285445690155, 'recall': 0.2741827070713043, 'f1': 0.23135605454444885}"", ""{'precision': 0.01473683025687933, 'recall': 0.23198658227920532, 'f1': 0.1224624440073967}"", ""{'precision': 0.31424480676651, 'recall': 0.09978776425123215, 'f1': 0.2060675323009491}"", ""{'precision': -0.09696684777736664, 'recall': 0.08984457701444626, 'f1': -0.0036923084408044815}"", ""{'precision': 0.2577022612094879, 'recall': 0.20712047815322876, 'f1': 0.23353365063667297}"", ""{'precision': 0.04533824324607849, 'recall': 0.1415725201368332, 'f1': 0.09447082877159119}"", ""{'precision': 0.15169040858745575, 'recall': 0.21877674758434296, 'f1': 0.18633955717086792}"", ""{'precision': 0.09471594542264938, 'recall': 0.08893232047557831, 'f1': 0.09329762309789658}"", ""{'precision': 0.13611166179180145, 'recall': 0.09732230752706528, 'f1': 0.11807652562856674}"", ""{'precision': -0.1604962795972824, 'recall': 0.15840131044387817, 'f1': -0.00455790851265192}"", ""{'precision': 0.08433659374713898, 'recall': 0.07663544267416, 'f1': 0.08197701722383499}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1035056673507767, 0.0671608869518552, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2584050114622343, 0.3223659397724296, 0.138290599624506, 0.0, 0.1969509557508073, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0986639785766601, 0.0, 0.0018812325738725, 0.0822918270022972, 0.0246503920127183, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0802679530882732, 0.1523317510883013, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0576822277357025]","[3.9166666666666665, 3.636363636363636, 0.4736842105263157, 3.4285714285714284, 10.0, 4.285714285714286, 3.8, 2.5833333333333335, 1.3548387096774193, 0.8857142857142857, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7333333333333334, 2.4, 5.35, 11.0, 4.888888888888889, 2.9, 2.7142857142857144, 1.9642857142857144, 2.260869565217391, 2.0, 2.2857142857142856, 4.333333333333333, 2.060606060606061, 0.925925925925926, 5.0, 1.7666666666666666, 4.2727272727272725, 8.875, 1.5454545454545454]","[""{'precision': 0.018605075776576996, 'recall': 0.027676809579133987, 'f1': 0.024723809212446213}"", ""{'precision': 0.11408830434083939, 'recall': 0.12945179641246796, 'f1': 0.12318607419729233}"", ""{'precision': -0.044818583875894547, 'recall': 0.039317525923252106, 'f1': -0.0014776296447962523}"", ""{'precision': 0.28842395544052124, 'recall': 0.400706022977829, 'f1': 0.3450360596179962}"", ""{'precision': -0.05558670684695244, 'recall': 0.05271483585238457, 'f1': -0.00039977935375645757}"", ""{'precision': 0.16830281913280487, 'recall': 0.07726295292377472, 'f1': 0.12379739433526993}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.017596537247300148, 'recall': 0.0009918430587276816, 'f1': 0.010889396071434021}"", ""{'precision': 0.3915248215198517, 'recall': 0.3192733824253082, 'f1': 0.35619881749153137}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.22101496160030365, 'recall': 0.1334792971611023, 'f1': 0.17820799350738525}"", ""{'precision': 0.1150352880358696, 'recall': 0.19117280840873718, 'f1': 0.1541975736618042}"", ""{'precision': 0.40110504627227783, 'recall': 0.40135687589645386, 'f1': 0.4022037982940674}"", ""{'precision': -0.0658365860581398, 'recall': 0.0735541507601738, 'f1': 0.004498577211052179}"", ""{'precision': -0.07433929294347763, 'recall': -0.10522875189781189, 'f1': -0.08806341141462326}"", ""{'precision': 0.06748929619789124, 'recall': 0.10652444511651993, 'f1': 0.08841516077518463}"", ""{'precision': 0.3841123580932617, 'recall': 0.2892446517944336, 'f1': 0.3373279571533203}"", ""{'precision': 0.03829863667488098, 'recall': 0.039665237069129944, 'f1': 0.04054334759712219}"", ""{'precision': 0.0621151439845562, 'recall': 0.06140831857919693, 'f1': 0.06328627467155457}"", ""{'precision': 0.2234218567609787, 'recall': 0.2235700637102127, 'f1': 0.22475756704807281}"", ""{'precision': 0.09432080388069153, 'recall': 0.19741639494895935, 'f1': 0.14673668146133423}"", ""{'precision': 0.17018228769302368, 'recall': 0.17701993882656097, 'f1': 0.17494195699691772}"", ""{'precision': -0.05711100995540619, 'recall': 0.15987704694271088, 'f1': 0.05057244002819061}"", ""{'precision': 0.1795092225074768, 'recall': 0.22820739448070526, 'f1': 0.20503807067871094}"", ""{'precision': 0.17392954230308533, 'recall': 0.1660403460264206, 'f1': 0.17133016884326935}"", ""{'precision': 0.24478335678577423, 'recall': 0.23942787945270538, 'f1': 0.2433353066444397}"", ""{'precision': 0.051276274025440216, 'recall': 0.03819303587079048, 'f1': 0.04627799242734909}"", ""{'precision': 0.0014669972006231546, 'recall': 0.09220745414495468, 'f1': 0.04797528684139252}"", ""{'precision': -0.14923645555973053, 'recall': 0.13711276650428772, 'f1': -0.008572653867304325}"", ""{'precision': 0.06578033417463303, 'recall': 0.1044427752494812, 'f1': 0.08652433007955551}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use (with examples): ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Format your answer as follows: (Teaching Method) (Response) Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.280274337093472, 0.0595901505578131, 0.0634508564975691, 0.0, 0.1072481046120325, 0.2331032305449905, 0.1887971609447683, 0.4482468976384072, 0.218167631398606, 0.2372445311148961, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1737546155282429, 0.1121535111154828, 0.1455629308592705, 0.2691694521503486, 0.0387265856899321, 0.1543118895803178, 0.1429861229229596, 0.2223921435844164, 0.1244109327523227, 0.0, 0.1376201412853196, 0.0359484198870081, 0.0885679996609688, 0.1497610494494438]","[2.4166666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 1.7142857142857142, 1.8571428571428572, 2.142857142857143, 2.4, 1.5833333333333333, 0.8064516129032258, 0.3714285714285714, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 3.0, 1.8888888888888888, 1.7, 2.4285714285714284, 1.1071428571428572, 0.9130434782608696, 0.56, 1.4285714285714286, 0.7777777777777778, 0.8181818181818182, 1.2592592592592593, 1.8571428571428572, 0.5333333333333333, 2.090909090909091, 1.875, 0.9090909090909092]","[""{'precision': 0.13864237070083618, 'recall': 0.22377946972846985, 'f1': 0.18218955397605896}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.29420068860054016, 'recall': 0.45664507150650024, 'f1': 0.37520068883895874}"", ""{'precision': 0.13351726531982422, 'recall': 0.29529616236686707, 'f1': 0.21441839635372162}"", ""{'precision': 0.29231661558151245, 'recall': 0.2771975100040436, 'f1': 0.28590792417526245}"", ""{'precision': -0.16725677251815796, 'recall': -0.02978040836751461, 'f1': -0.09770578891038895}"", ""{'precision': 0.218782439827919, 'recall': 0.24108827114105225, 'f1': 0.2311628758907318}"", ""{'precision': 0.24765720963478088, 'recall': 0.2681216597557068, 'f1': 0.25907573103904724}"", ""{'precision': 0.17579273879528046, 'recall': 0.0702231302857399, 'f1': 0.12388003617525101}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.08622314035892487, 'recall': 0.32667577266693115, 'f1': 0.2049374133348465}"", ""{'precision': 0.25753599405288696, 'recall': 0.3161171078681946, 'f1': 0.2878223955631256}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.13379955291748047, 'recall': 0.09721406549215317, 'f1': 0.11687683314085007}"", ""{'precision': 0.015880854800343513, 'recall': 0.0830654427409172, 'f1': 0.05079316720366478}"", ""{'precision': 0.23008720576763153, 'recall': 0.4026769995689392, 'f1': 0.31608065962791443}"", ""{'precision': 0.296329528093338, 'recall': 0.46848103404045105, 'f1': 0.38202130794525146}"", ""{'precision': 0.12538881599903107, 'recall': 0.12354177236557007, 'f1': 0.12588776648044586}"", ""{'precision': 0.3607337772846222, 'recall': 0.31556951999664307, 'f1': 0.33912941813468933}"", ""{'precision': -0.07983797043561935, 'recall': 0.057360295206308365, 'f1': -0.010546828620135784}"", ""{'precision': 0.31597214937210083, 'recall': 0.2876557409763336, 'f1': 0.3029094934463501}"", ""{'precision': 0.09233592450618744, 'recall': 0.2008637934923172, 'f1': 0.14741015434265137}"", ""{'precision': 0.22945044934749603, 'recall': 0.2754858434200287, 'f1': 0.2535819411277771}"", ""{'precision': 0.1828542798757553, 'recall': 0.2094971388578415, 'f1': 0.19744791090488434}"", ""{'precision': 0.10266786813735962, 'recall': 0.19699440896511078, 'f1': 0.1507779061794281}"", ""{'precision': 0.10981395095586777, 'recall': 0.047144029289484024, 'f1': 0.07977928966283798}"", ""{'precision': 0.09698135405778885, 'recall': 0.290243923664093, 'f1': 0.1931089609861374}"", ""{'precision': 0.07298797369003296, 'recall': 0.2475324124097824, 'f1': 0.16013599932193756}"", ""{'precision': 0.09527769684791565, 'recall': 0.10083868354558945, 'f1': 0.09952209889888763}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.0602024057870188, 0.0369230996710913, 0.0334222354874107, 0.0, 0.0172822121316674, 0.2822177794147447, 0.1264396151914723, 0.4482468976384072, 0.2166361496557471, 0.2112315144141515, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1458772459155634, 0.0484547153022719, 0.0976198112765639, 0.1287198804729226, 0.0252047787261781, 0.0963881797449929, 0.0319340280246817, 0.2765885904901324, 0.0176132574100486, 0.0, 0.1542999093435335, 0.2538067443387491, 0.0, 0.1461071665346364]","[2.1666666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 2.7142857142857144, 1.7142857142857142, 2.142857142857143, 1.4, 1.3333333333333333, 0.3870967741935484, 0.6285714285714286, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 4.8, 1.5555555555555556, 2.7, 2.142857142857143, 0.6071428571428571, 1.608695652173913, 1.2, 1.7857142857142858, 1.1111111111111112, 0.4545454545454545, 1.4074074074074074, 3.2857142857142856, 0.5333333333333333, 1.3636363636363635, 5.125, 0.8181818181818182]","[""{'precision': 0.11144650727510452, 'recall': 0.16678740084171295, 'f1': 0.1403663456439972}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.16733106970787048, 'recall': 0.34498879313468933, 'f1': 0.2558545470237732}"", ""{'precision': 0.14777971804141998, 'recall': 0.12287995219230652, 'f1': 0.13670334219932556}"", ""{'precision': 0.14047302305698395, 'recall': 0.16943396627902985, 'f1': 0.15628546476364136}"", ""{'precision': -0.1741969883441925, 'recall': -0.2152625024318695, 'f1': -0.19287870824337006}"", ""{'precision': 0.10095961391925812, 'recall': -0.010690257884562016, 'f1': 0.04605867713689804}"", ""{'precision': 0.4403025507926941, 'recall': 0.15784242749214172, 'f1': 0.29640036821365356}"", ""{'precision': 0.1082160696387291, 'recall': -0.02357855811715126, 'f1': 0.043000295758247375}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.0672667920589447, 'recall': 0.34117069840431213, 'f1': 0.20187444984912872}"", ""{'precision': 0.21142058074474335, 'recall': 0.2578919529914856, 'f1': 0.23579636216163635}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.07662168145179749, 'recall': -0.05927005410194397, 'f1': 0.00935102254152298}"", ""{'precision': -0.02370366081595421, 'recall': -0.02631603181362152, 'f1': -0.02334471233189106}"", ""{'precision': 0.3802837133407593, 'recall': 0.37594321370124817, 'f1': 0.37912291288375854}"", ""{'precision': 0.22057241201400757, 'recall': 0.2892892360687256, 'f1': 0.25591564178466797}"", ""{'precision': 0.13475148379802704, 'recall': -0.040554143488407135, 'f1': 0.047102976590394974}"", ""{'precision': 0.2246946543455124, 'recall': 0.10567621141672134, 'f1': 0.16584555804729462}"", ""{'precision': -0.022776130586862564, 'recall': 0.083047054708004, 'f1': 0.031150298193097115}"", ""{'precision': 0.2631351351737976, 'recall': 0.2743387222290039, 'f1': 0.269919216632843}"", ""{'precision': -0.08870362490415573, 'recall': 0.10129321366548538, 'f1': 0.006090278271585703}"", ""{'precision': 0.42749470472335815, 'recall': 0.1397526115179062, 'f1': 0.28082096576690674}"", ""{'precision': 0.06014829874038696, 'recall': 0.12220893800258636, 'f1': 0.09246557205915451}"", ""{'precision': 0.2430046945810318, 'recall': 0.3270018994808197, 'f1': 0.2858295142650604}"", ""{'precision': 0.14836622774600983, 'recall': 0.00877873133867979, 'f1': 0.07909627258777618}"", ""{'precision': 0.2596312463283539, 'recall': 0.2833509147167206, 'f1': 0.2726484537124634}"", ""{'precision': -0.04212549328804016, 'recall': 0.2262428104877472, 'f1': 0.0899641290307045}"", ""{'precision': 0.13963252305984497, 'recall': 0.06494591385126114, 'f1': 0.10346974432468414}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  Directly answer the student's question.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.1387281377207149, 0.0326287712524776, 0.0931273669314074, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3685939814893283, 0.3223659397724296, 0.2835382546816534, 0.0353186986044697, 0.2098288242723427, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1303345371663271, 0.1411195762450153, 0.2307743706703186, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1447803716874165, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0144460941817118, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.0833333333333335, 1.6363636363636365, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7857142857142856, 5.142857142857143, 8.285714285714286, 3.8, 3.6666666666666665, 0.7741935483870968, 0.8857142857142857, 1.2105263157894737, 2.0, 2.3333333333333335, 2.75, 6.8, 6.888888888888889, 3.7, 5.571428571428571, 0.9642857142857144, 1.6521739130434785, 0.92, 3.2857142857142856, 5.111111111111111, 1.4848484848484849, 2.2222222222222223, 4.571428571428571, 1.3666666666666667, 2.727272727272727, 8.75, 2.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.11432495713233948, 'recall': 0.03324726223945618, 'f1': 0.07496145367622375}"", ""{'precision': 0.34705960750579834, 'recall': 0.16323672235012054, 'f1': 0.2547290027141571}"", ""{'precision': -0.04055697098374367, 'recall': 0.13544459640979767, 'f1': 0.047443777322769165}"", ""{'precision': 0.2874433696269989, 'recall': 0.3909418284893036, 'f1': 0.33976122736930847}"", ""{'precision': 0.013704590499401093, 'recall': 0.1261105239391327, 'f1': 0.07079096138477325}"", ""{'precision': 0.0022958312183618546, 'recall': 0.0070695350877940655, 'f1': 0.006298996973782778}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.04759303852915764, 'recall': 0.14297078549861908, 'f1': 0.09630267322063446}"", ""{'precision': 0.5061132907867432, 'recall': 0.3179398477077484, 'f1': 0.4113249182701111}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.3297567069530487, 'recall': 0.20683324337005615, 'f1': 0.268756240606308}"", ""{'precision': 0.0749378353357315, 'recall': 0.11573436856269836, 'f1': 0.09672435373067856}"", ""{'precision': 0.4073179364204407, 'recall': 0.39869120717048645, 'f1': 0.4039713740348816}"", ""{'precision': -0.009095241315662861, 'recall': 0.020507877692580223, 'f1': 0.007277961820363998}"", ""{'precision': -0.06473217904567719, 'recall': -0.034142181277275085, 'f1': -0.047779280692338943}"", ""{'precision': -0.04261331260204315, 'recall': 0.1446707844734192, 'f1': 0.050818946212530136}"", ""{'precision': 0.3305618166923523, 'recall': 0.26773256063461304, 'f1': 0.30009621381759644}"", ""{'precision': -0.031261153519153595, 'recall': 0.018836529925465584, 'f1': -0.004703410901129246}"", ""{'precision': 0.15156836807727814, 'recall': 0.07251915335655212, 'f1': 0.11317533999681473}"", ""{'precision': 0.22911085188388824, 'recall': 0.17426548898220062, 'f1': 0.20283786952495575}"", ""{'precision': 0.24250556528568268, 'recall': 0.2621985375881195, 'f1': 0.2535487413406372}"", ""{'precision': 0.19026708602905273, 'recall': 0.1819763332605362, 'f1': 0.18744036555290222}"", ""{'precision': -0.07508712261915207, 'recall': 0.037153083831071854, 'f1': -0.017948396503925323}"", ""{'precision': 0.2166709154844284, 'recall': 0.17746104300022125, 'f1': 0.19829514622688293}"", ""{'precision': 0.07609530538320541, 'recall': 0.12819607555866241, 'f1': 0.10347115993499756}"", ""{'precision': 0.23566016554832458, 'recall': 0.2002030313014984, 'f1': 0.2191401720046997}"", ""{'precision': 0.039474498480558395, 'recall': 0.03034212253987789, 'f1': 0.03647209703922272}"", ""{'precision': 0.17368051409721375, 'recall': 0.15962590277194977, 'f1': 0.16799703240394592}"", ""{'precision': -0.06723884493112564, 'recall': 0.22073249518871307, 'f1': 0.07412375509738922}"", ""{'precision': 0.13290952146053314, 'recall': 0.07355167716741562, 'f1': 0.1045115739107132}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1231552158867506, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1595867466221573, 0.2816988029230364, 0.0375123027908174, 0.0, 0.121658365925153, 0.0026883850904072, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1601171066931316, 0.0, 0.118127981268613, 0.023413470249148, 0.1743353397675923, 0.017465844953817, 0.0, 0.1669695384489661, 0.1627683104536919, 0.0, 0.0606433872310888, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.1666666666666665, 3.8181818181818183, 1.105263157894737, 4.357142857142857, 8.142857142857142, 8.285714285714286, 6.2, 3.6666666666666665, 1.903225806451613, 1.0285714285714285, 2.5789473684210527, 4.0, 2.8666666666666667, 2.15, 5.8, 4.333333333333333, 2.3, 6.714285714285714, 1.5357142857142858, 2.869565217391304, 1.24, 2.0714285714285716, 3.111111111111111, 1.5454545454545454, 1.037037037037037, 4.714285714285714, 1.2666666666666666, 2.4545454545454546, 2.25, 3.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.10684812068939209, 'recall': 0.03631405159831047, 'f1': 0.07283965498209}"", ""{'precision': 0.18081633746623993, 'recall': 0.21930274367332458, 'f1': 0.20128819346427917}"", ""{'precision': 0.17166095972061157, 'recall': 0.13189461827278137, 'f1': 0.15307734906673431}"", ""{'precision': 0.2035761922597885, 'recall': 0.36162516474723816, 'f1': 0.28257477283477783}"", ""{'precision': -0.007911596447229385, 'recall': 0.07360721379518509, 'f1': 0.03408719226717949}"", ""{'precision': -0.029209056869149208, 'recall': -0.0254511758685112, 'f1': -0.025661807507276535}"", ""{'precision': -0.28529930114746094, 'recall': -0.1471974402666092, 'f1': -0.21527764201164246}"", ""{'precision': 0.06908895075321198, 'recall': 0.19120818376541138, 'f1': 0.1308295577764511}"", ""{'precision': 0.24328982830047607, 'recall': 0.3773156702518463, 'f1': 0.3105713427066803}"", ""{'precision': 0.37962114810943604, 'recall': 0.23239125311374664, 'f1': 0.30609819293022156}"", ""{'precision': 0.14460481703281403, 'recall': 0.2137676626443863, 'f1': 0.18028776347637177}"", ""{'precision': 0.054828621447086334, 'recall': 0.1578940600156784, 'f1': 0.10728989541530609}"", ""{'precision': 0.3231819272041321, 'recall': 0.42914193868637085, 'f1': 0.3766500651836395}"", ""{'precision': 0.06238151714205742, 'recall': 0.07595311105251312, 'f1': 0.07067088782787323}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.040648944675922394, 'recall': 0.0014439028454944491, 'f1': 0.02255857363343239}"", ""{'precision': 0.33503711223602295, 'recall': 0.3662688434123993, 'f1': 0.3516627848148346}"", ""{'precision': -0.0808199793100357, 'recall': 0.04339419677853584, 'f1': -0.017838211730122566}"", ""{'precision': 0.17228850722312927, 'recall': 0.16112887859344482, 'f1': 0.16805635392665863}"", ""{'precision': 0.16065724194049835, 'recall': 0.2842628061771393, 'f1': 0.22298717498779297}"", ""{'precision': 0.19424818456172943, 'recall': 0.25405827164649963, 'f1': 0.22524210810661316}"", ""{'precision': 0.20658765733242035, 'recall': 0.1472964882850647, 'f1': 0.17810629308223724}"", ""{'precision': 0.02119770273566246, 'recall': 0.08223419636487961, 'f1': 0.0530717670917511}"", ""{'precision': 0.3092431426048279, 'recall': 0.23614603281021118, 'f1': 0.273618221282959}"", ""{'precision': 0.15373331308364868, 'recall': 0.1726284623146057, 'f1': 0.16452297568321228}"", ""{'precision': 0.1746618002653122, 'recall': 0.22373667359352112, 'f1': 0.20038409531116486}"", ""{'precision': 0.08880196511745453, 'recall': 0.07461851090192795, 'f1': 0.08319153636693954}"", ""{'precision': 0.1476742923259735, 'recall': 0.07884303480386734, 'f1': 0.11446332186460495}"", ""{'precision': -0.23309831321239471, 'recall': 0.09990908950567245, 'f1': -0.07053916156291962}"", ""{'precision': 0.03019283153116703, 'recall': 0.08091480284929276, 'f1': 0.05696043372154236}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.01413928988305, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.232914392851028, 0.288552621816469, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0777051775670442, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1016052632718472, 0.0, 0.1037397015701301, 0.0456987312059718, 0.0722312220036983, 0.1387480518647602, 0.0, 0.1161288667856411, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0851336600337967, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[5.666666666666667, 2.636363636363636, 2.789473684210526, 3.928571428571429, 6.714285714285714, 6.142857142857143, 7.0, 4.25, 1.4838709677419355, 1.0285714285714285, 2.789473684210526, 3.4, 3.0, 4.9, 5.8, 6.111111111111111, 2.5, 5.142857142857143, 1.5357142857142858, 2.652173913043478, 1.64, 1.1428571428571428, 6.888888888888889, 1.8484848484848484, 3.0, 5.714285714285714, 1.1, 2.909090909090909, 5.125, 2.6818181818181817]","[""{'precision': -0.09311841428279877, 'recall': -0.01294065173715353, 'f1': -0.051645345985889435}"", ""{'precision': 0.2109493762254715, 'recall': 0.20667512714862823, 'f1': 0.21009676158428192}"", ""{'precision': -0.02898159623146057, 'recall': 0.15586157143115997, 'f1': 0.0632597804069519}"", ""{'precision': 0.25616416335105896, 'recall': 0.3921296298503876, 'f1': 0.32437044382095337}"", ""{'precision': -0.03161277994513512, 'recall': 0.057851266115903854, 'f1': 0.014321071095764637}"", ""{'precision': -0.03530910238623619, 'recall': 0.05106435716152191, 'f1': 0.009115110151469707}"", ""{'precision': -0.35257774591445923, 'recall': -0.09080387651920319, 'f1': -0.22332797944545746}"", ""{'precision': 0.01716284081339836, 'recall': 0.16772548854351044, 'f1': 0.09279683977365494}"", ""{'precision': 0.3477271497249603, 'recall': 0.3651588559150696, 'f1': 0.35747477412223816}"", ""{'precision': 0.4063907563686371, 'recall': 0.23384788632392883, 'f1': 0.3198058307170868}"", ""{'precision': 0.09873276203870773, 'recall': 0.18228335678577423, 'f1': 0.14156284928321838}"", ""{'precision': 0.09469754993915558, 'recall': 0.19298988580703735, 'f1': 0.14476250112056732}"", ""{'precision': 0.32154300808906555, 'recall': 0.36767488718032837, 'f1': 0.345574289560318}"", ""{'precision': -0.08242210745811462, 'recall': 0.07026062160730362, 'f1': -0.005622691474854946}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.0636489987373352, 'recall': 0.29298919439315796, 'f1': 0.17709165811538696}"", ""{'precision': 0.32472991943359375, 'recall': 0.4210628569126129, 'f1': 0.37348079681396484}"", ""{'precision': 0.011358527466654778, 'recall': 0.052887097001075745, 'f1': 0.03360971808433533}"", ""{'precision': 0.17086820304393768, 'recall': 0.14884509146213531, 'f1': 0.16119760274887085}"", ""{'precision': 0.18676285445690155, 'recall': 0.2741827070713043, 'f1': 0.23135605454444885}"", ""{'precision': 0.01473683025687933, 'recall': 0.23198658227920532, 'f1': 0.1224624440073967}"", ""{'precision': 0.31424480676651, 'recall': 0.09978776425123215, 'f1': 0.2060675323009491}"", ""{'precision': -0.09696684777736664, 'recall': 0.08984457701444626, 'f1': -0.0036923084408044815}"", ""{'precision': 0.2577022612094879, 'recall': 0.20712047815322876, 'f1': 0.23353365063667297}"", ""{'precision': 0.04533824324607849, 'recall': 0.1415725201368332, 'f1': 0.09447082877159119}"", ""{'precision': 0.15169040858745575, 'recall': 0.21877674758434296, 'f1': 0.18633955717086792}"", ""{'precision': 0.09471594542264938, 'recall': 0.08893232047557831, 'f1': 0.09329762309789658}"", ""{'precision': 0.13611166179180145, 'recall': 0.09732230752706528, 'f1': 0.11807652562856674}"", ""{'precision': -0.1604962795972824, 'recall': 0.15840131044387817, 'f1': -0.00455790851265192}"", ""{'precision': 0.08433659374713898, 'recall': 0.07663544267416, 'f1': 0.08197701722383499}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1035056673507767, 0.0671608869518552, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2584050114622343, 0.3223659397724296, 0.138290599624506, 0.0, 0.1969509557508073, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0986639785766601, 0.0, 0.0018812325738725, 0.0822918270022972, 0.0246503920127183, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0802679530882732, 0.1523317510883013, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0576822277357025]","[3.9166666666666665, 3.636363636363636, 0.4736842105263157, 3.4285714285714284, 10.0, 4.285714285714286, 3.8, 2.5833333333333335, 1.3548387096774193, 0.8857142857142857, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7333333333333334, 2.4, 5.35, 11.0, 4.888888888888889, 2.9, 2.7142857142857144, 1.9642857142857144, 2.260869565217391, 2.0, 2.2857142857142856, 4.333333333333333, 2.060606060606061, 0.925925925925926, 5.0, 1.7666666666666666, 4.2727272727272725, 8.875, 1.5454545454545454]","[""{'precision': 0.018605075776576996, 'recall': 0.027676809579133987, 'f1': 0.024723809212446213}"", ""{'precision': 0.11408830434083939, 'recall': 0.12945179641246796, 'f1': 0.12318607419729233}"", ""{'precision': -0.044818583875894547, 'recall': 0.039317525923252106, 'f1': -0.0014776296447962523}"", ""{'precision': 0.28842395544052124, 'recall': 0.400706022977829, 'f1': 0.3450360596179962}"", ""{'precision': -0.05558670684695244, 'recall': 0.05271483585238457, 'f1': -0.00039977935375645757}"", ""{'precision': 0.16830281913280487, 'recall': 0.07726295292377472, 'f1': 0.12379739433526993}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.017596537247300148, 'recall': 0.0009918430587276816, 'f1': 0.010889396071434021}"", ""{'precision': 0.3915248215198517, 'recall': 0.3192733824253082, 'f1': 0.35619881749153137}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.22101496160030365, 'recall': 0.1334792971611023, 'f1': 0.17820799350738525}"", ""{'precision': 0.1150352880358696, 'recall': 0.19117280840873718, 'f1': 0.1541975736618042}"", ""{'precision': 0.40110504627227783, 'recall': 0.40135687589645386, 'f1': 0.4022037982940674}"", ""{'precision': -0.0658365860581398, 'recall': 0.0735541507601738, 'f1': 0.004498577211052179}"", ""{'precision': -0.07433929294347763, 'recall': -0.10522875189781189, 'f1': -0.08806341141462326}"", ""{'precision': 0.06748929619789124, 'recall': 0.10652444511651993, 'f1': 0.08841516077518463}"", ""{'precision': 0.3841123580932617, 'recall': 0.2892446517944336, 'f1': 0.3373279571533203}"", ""{'precision': 0.03829863667488098, 'recall': 0.039665237069129944, 'f1': 0.04054334759712219}"", ""{'precision': 0.0621151439845562, 'recall': 0.06140831857919693, 'f1': 0.06328627467155457}"", ""{'precision': 0.2234218567609787, 'recall': 0.2235700637102127, 'f1': 0.22475756704807281}"", ""{'precision': 0.09432080388069153, 'recall': 0.19741639494895935, 'f1': 0.14673668146133423}"", ""{'precision': 0.17018228769302368, 'recall': 0.17701993882656097, 'f1': 0.17494195699691772}"", ""{'precision': -0.05711100995540619, 'recall': 0.15987704694271088, 'f1': 0.05057244002819061}"", ""{'precision': 0.1795092225074768, 'recall': 0.22820739448070526, 'f1': 0.20503807067871094}"", ""{'precision': 0.17392954230308533, 'recall': 0.1660403460264206, 'f1': 0.17133016884326935}"", ""{'precision': 0.24478335678577423, 'recall': 0.23942787945270538, 'f1': 0.2433353066444397}"", ""{'precision': 0.051276274025440216, 'recall': 0.03819303587079048, 'f1': 0.04627799242734909}"", ""{'precision': 0.0014669972006231546, 'recall': 0.09220745414495468, 'f1': 0.04797528684139252}"", ""{'precision': -0.14923645555973053, 'recall': 0.13711276650428772, 'f1': -0.008572653867304325}"", ""{'precision': 0.06578033417463303, 'recall': 0.1044427752494812, 'f1': 0.08652433007955551}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use (with examples): ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Format your answer as follows: (Teaching Method) (Response) Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.280274337093472, 0.0595901505578131, 0.0634508564975691, 0.0, 0.1072481046120325, 0.2331032305449905, 0.1887971609447683, 0.4482468976384072, 0.218167631398606, 0.2372445311148961, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1737546155282429, 0.1121535111154828, 0.1455629308592705, 0.2691694521503486, 0.0387265856899321, 0.1543118895803178, 0.1429861229229596, 0.2223921435844164, 0.1244109327523227, 0.0, 0.1376201412853196, 0.0359484198870081, 0.0885679996609688, 0.1497610494494438]","[2.4166666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 1.7142857142857142, 1.8571428571428572, 2.142857142857143, 2.4, 1.5833333333333333, 0.8064516129032258, 0.3714285714285714, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 3.0, 1.8888888888888888, 1.7, 2.4285714285714284, 1.1071428571428572, 0.9130434782608696, 0.56, 1.4285714285714286, 0.7777777777777778, 0.8181818181818182, 1.2592592592592593, 1.8571428571428572, 0.5333333333333333, 2.090909090909091, 1.875, 0.9090909090909092]","[""{'precision': 0.13864237070083618, 'recall': 0.22377946972846985, 'f1': 0.18218955397605896}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.29420068860054016, 'recall': 0.45664507150650024, 'f1': 0.37520068883895874}"", ""{'precision': 0.13351726531982422, 'recall': 0.29529616236686707, 'f1': 0.21441839635372162}"", ""{'precision': 0.29231661558151245, 'recall': 0.2771975100040436, 'f1': 0.28590792417526245}"", ""{'precision': -0.16725677251815796, 'recall': -0.02978040836751461, 'f1': -0.09770578891038895}"", ""{'precision': 0.218782439827919, 'recall': 0.24108827114105225, 'f1': 0.2311628758907318}"", ""{'precision': 0.24765720963478088, 'recall': 0.2681216597557068, 'f1': 0.25907573103904724}"", ""{'precision': 0.17579273879528046, 'recall': 0.0702231302857399, 'f1': 0.12388003617525101}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.08622314035892487, 'recall': 0.32667577266693115, 'f1': 0.2049374133348465}"", ""{'precision': 0.25753599405288696, 'recall': 0.3161171078681946, 'f1': 0.2878223955631256}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.13379955291748047, 'recall': 0.09721406549215317, 'f1': 0.11687683314085007}"", ""{'precision': 0.015880854800343513, 'recall': 0.0830654427409172, 'f1': 0.05079316720366478}"", ""{'precision': 0.23008720576763153, 'recall': 0.4026769995689392, 'f1': 0.31608065962791443}"", ""{'precision': 0.296329528093338, 'recall': 0.46848103404045105, 'f1': 0.38202130794525146}"", ""{'precision': 0.12538881599903107, 'recall': 0.12354177236557007, 'f1': 0.12588776648044586}"", ""{'precision': 0.3607337772846222, 'recall': 0.31556951999664307, 'f1': 0.33912941813468933}"", ""{'precision': -0.07983797043561935, 'recall': 0.057360295206308365, 'f1': -0.010546828620135784}"", ""{'precision': 0.31597214937210083, 'recall': 0.2876557409763336, 'f1': 0.3029094934463501}"", ""{'precision': 0.09233592450618744, 'recall': 0.2008637934923172, 'f1': 0.14741015434265137}"", ""{'precision': 0.22945044934749603, 'recall': 0.2754858434200287, 'f1': 0.2535819411277771}"", ""{'precision': 0.1828542798757553, 'recall': 0.2094971388578415, 'f1': 0.19744791090488434}"", ""{'precision': 0.10266786813735962, 'recall': 0.19699440896511078, 'f1': 0.1507779061794281}"", ""{'precision': 0.10981395095586777, 'recall': 0.047144029289484024, 'f1': 0.07977928966283798}"", ""{'precision': 0.09698135405778885, 'recall': 0.290243923664093, 'f1': 0.1931089609861374}"", ""{'precision': 0.07298797369003296, 'recall': 0.2475324124097824, 'f1': 0.16013599932193756}"", ""{'precision': 0.09527769684791565, 'recall': 0.10083868354558945, 'f1': 0.09952209889888763}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.0602024057870188, 0.0369230996710913, 0.0334222354874107, 0.0, 0.0172822121316674, 0.2822177794147447, 0.1264396151914723, 0.4482468976384072, 0.2166361496557471, 0.2112315144141515, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1458772459155634, 0.0484547153022719, 0.0976198112765639, 0.1287198804729226, 0.0252047787261781, 0.0963881797449929, 0.0319340280246817, 0.2765885904901324, 0.0176132574100486, 0.0, 0.1542999093435335, 0.2538067443387491, 0.0, 0.1461071665346364]","[2.1666666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 2.7142857142857144, 1.7142857142857142, 2.142857142857143, 1.4, 1.3333333333333333, 0.3870967741935484, 0.6285714285714286, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 4.8, 1.5555555555555556, 2.7, 2.142857142857143, 0.6071428571428571, 1.608695652173913, 1.2, 1.7857142857142858, 1.1111111111111112, 0.4545454545454545, 1.4074074074074074, 3.2857142857142856, 0.5333333333333333, 1.3636363636363635, 5.125, 0.8181818181818182]","[""{'precision': 0.11144650727510452, 'recall': 0.16678740084171295, 'f1': 0.1403663456439972}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.16733106970787048, 'recall': 0.34498879313468933, 'f1': 0.2558545470237732}"", ""{'precision': 0.14777971804141998, 'recall': 0.12287995219230652, 'f1': 0.13670334219932556}"", ""{'precision': 0.14047302305698395, 'recall': 0.16943396627902985, 'f1': 0.15628546476364136}"", ""{'precision': -0.1741969883441925, 'recall': -0.2152625024318695, 'f1': -0.19287870824337006}"", ""{'precision': 0.10095961391925812, 'recall': -0.010690257884562016, 'f1': 0.04605867713689804}"", ""{'precision': 0.4403025507926941, 'recall': 0.15784242749214172, 'f1': 0.29640036821365356}"", ""{'precision': 0.1082160696387291, 'recall': -0.02357855811715126, 'f1': 0.043000295758247375}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.0672667920589447, 'recall': 0.34117069840431213, 'f1': 0.20187444984912872}"", ""{'precision': 0.21142058074474335, 'recall': 0.2578919529914856, 'f1': 0.23579636216163635}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.07662168145179749, 'recall': -0.05927005410194397, 'f1': 0.00935102254152298}"", ""{'precision': -0.02370366081595421, 'recall': -0.02631603181362152, 'f1': -0.02334471233189106}"", ""{'precision': 0.3802837133407593, 'recall': 0.37594321370124817, 'f1': 0.37912291288375854}"", ""{'precision': 0.22057241201400757, 'recall': 0.2892892360687256, 'f1': 0.25591564178466797}"", ""{'precision': 0.13475148379802704, 'recall': -0.040554143488407135, 'f1': 0.047102976590394974}"", ""{'precision': 0.2246946543455124, 'recall': 0.10567621141672134, 'f1': 0.16584555804729462}"", ""{'precision': -0.022776130586862564, 'recall': 0.083047054708004, 'f1': 0.031150298193097115}"", ""{'precision': 0.2631351351737976, 'recall': 0.2743387222290039, 'f1': 0.269919216632843}"", ""{'precision': -0.08870362490415573, 'recall': 0.10129321366548538, 'f1': 0.006090278271585703}"", ""{'precision': 0.42749470472335815, 'recall': 0.1397526115179062, 'f1': 0.28082096576690674}"", ""{'precision': 0.06014829874038696, 'recall': 0.12220893800258636, 'f1': 0.09246557205915451}"", ""{'precision': 0.2430046945810318, 'recall': 0.3270018994808197, 'f1': 0.2858295142650604}"", ""{'precision': 0.14836622774600983, 'recall': 0.00877873133867979, 'f1': 0.07909627258777618}"", ""{'precision': 0.2596312463283539, 'recall': 0.2833509147167206, 'f1': 0.2726484537124634}"", ""{'precision': -0.04212549328804016, 'recall': 0.2262428104877472, 'f1': 0.0899641290307045}"", ""{'precision': 0.13963252305984497, 'recall': 0.06494591385126114, 'f1': 0.10346974432468414}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  Directly answer the student's question.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.1387281377207149, 0.0326287712524776, 0.0931273669314074, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3685939814893283, 0.3223659397724296, 0.2835382546816534, 0.0353186986044697, 0.2098288242723427, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1303345371663271, 0.1411195762450153, 0.2307743706703186, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1447803716874165, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0144460941817118, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.0833333333333335, 1.6363636363636365, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7857142857142856, 5.142857142857143, 8.285714285714286, 3.8, 3.6666666666666665, 0.7741935483870968, 0.8857142857142857, 1.2105263157894737, 2.0, 2.3333333333333335, 2.75, 6.8, 6.888888888888889, 3.7, 5.571428571428571, 0.9642857142857144, 1.6521739130434785, 0.92, 3.2857142857142856, 5.111111111111111, 1.4848484848484849, 2.2222222222222223, 4.571428571428571, 1.3666666666666667, 2.727272727272727, 8.75, 2.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.11432495713233948, 'recall': 0.03324726223945618, 'f1': 0.07496145367622375}"", ""{'precision': 0.34705960750579834, 'recall': 0.16323672235012054, 'f1': 0.2547290027141571}"", ""{'precision': -0.04055697098374367, 'recall': 0.13544459640979767, 'f1': 0.047443777322769165}"", ""{'precision': 0.2874433696269989, 'recall': 0.3909418284893036, 'f1': 0.33976122736930847}"", ""{'precision': 0.013704590499401093, 'recall': 0.1261105239391327, 'f1': 0.07079096138477325}"", ""{'precision': 0.0022958312183618546, 'recall': 0.0070695350877940655, 'f1': 0.006298996973782778}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.04759303852915764, 'recall': 0.14297078549861908, 'f1': 0.09630267322063446}"", ""{'precision': 0.5061132907867432, 'recall': 0.3179398477077484, 'f1': 0.4113249182701111}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.3297567069530487, 'recall': 0.20683324337005615, 'f1': 0.268756240606308}"", ""{'precision': 0.0749378353357315, 'recall': 0.11573436856269836, 'f1': 0.09672435373067856}"", ""{'precision': 0.4073179364204407, 'recall': 0.39869120717048645, 'f1': 0.4039713740348816}"", ""{'precision': -0.009095241315662861, 'recall': 0.020507877692580223, 'f1': 0.007277961820363998}"", ""{'precision': -0.06473217904567719, 'recall': -0.034142181277275085, 'f1': -0.047779280692338943}"", ""{'precision': -0.04261331260204315, 'recall': 0.1446707844734192, 'f1': 0.050818946212530136}"", ""{'precision': 0.3305618166923523, 'recall': 0.26773256063461304, 'f1': 0.30009621381759644}"", ""{'precision': -0.031261153519153595, 'recall': 0.018836529925465584, 'f1': -0.004703410901129246}"", ""{'precision': 0.15156836807727814, 'recall': 0.07251915335655212, 'f1': 0.11317533999681473}"", ""{'precision': 0.22911085188388824, 'recall': 0.17426548898220062, 'f1': 0.20283786952495575}"", ""{'precision': 0.24250556528568268, 'recall': 0.2621985375881195, 'f1': 0.2535487413406372}"", ""{'precision': 0.19026708602905273, 'recall': 0.1819763332605362, 'f1': 0.18744036555290222}"", ""{'precision': -0.07508712261915207, 'recall': 0.037153083831071854, 'f1': -0.017948396503925323}"", ""{'precision': 0.2166709154844284, 'recall': 0.17746104300022125, 'f1': 0.19829514622688293}"", ""{'precision': 0.07609530538320541, 'recall': 0.12819607555866241, 'f1': 0.10347115993499756}"", ""{'precision': 0.23566016554832458, 'recall': 0.2002030313014984, 'f1': 0.2191401720046997}"", ""{'precision': 0.039474498480558395, 'recall': 0.03034212253987789, 'f1': 0.03647209703922272}"", ""{'precision': 0.17368051409721375, 'recall': 0.15962590277194977, 'f1': 0.16799703240394592}"", ""{'precision': -0.06723884493112564, 'recall': 0.22073249518871307, 'f1': 0.07412375509738922}"", ""{'precision': 0.13290952146053314, 'recall': 0.07355167716741562, 'f1': 0.1045115739107132}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1231552158867506, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1595867466221573, 0.2816988029230364, 0.0375123027908174, 0.0, 0.121658365925153, 0.0026883850904072, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1601171066931316, 0.0, 0.118127981268613, 0.023413470249148, 0.1743353397675923, 0.017465844953817, 0.0, 0.1669695384489661, 0.1627683104536919, 0.0, 0.0606433872310888, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.1666666666666665, 3.8181818181818183, 1.105263157894737, 4.357142857142857, 8.142857142857142, 8.285714285714286, 6.2, 3.6666666666666665, 1.903225806451613, 1.0285714285714285, 2.5789473684210527, 4.0, 2.8666666666666667, 2.15, 5.8, 4.333333333333333, 2.3, 6.714285714285714, 1.5357142857142858, 2.869565217391304, 1.24, 2.0714285714285716, 3.111111111111111, 1.5454545454545454, 1.037037037037037, 4.714285714285714, 1.2666666666666666, 2.4545454545454546, 2.25, 3.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.10684812068939209, 'recall': 0.03631405159831047, 'f1': 0.07283965498209}"", ""{'precision': 0.18081633746623993, 'recall': 0.21930274367332458, 'f1': 0.20128819346427917}"", ""{'precision': 0.17166095972061157, 'recall': 0.13189461827278137, 'f1': 0.15307734906673431}"", ""{'precision': 0.2035761922597885, 'recall': 0.36162516474723816, 'f1': 0.28257477283477783}"", ""{'precision': -0.007911596447229385, 'recall': 0.07360721379518509, 'f1': 0.03408719226717949}"", ""{'precision': -0.029209056869149208, 'recall': -0.0254511758685112, 'f1': -0.025661807507276535}"", ""{'precision': -0.28529930114746094, 'recall': -0.1471974402666092, 'f1': -0.21527764201164246}"", ""{'precision': 0.06908895075321198, 'recall': 0.19120818376541138, 'f1': 0.1308295577764511}"", ""{'precision': 0.24328982830047607, 'recall': 0.3773156702518463, 'f1': 0.3105713427066803}"", ""{'precision': 0.37962114810943604, 'recall': 0.23239125311374664, 'f1': 0.30609819293022156}"", ""{'precision': 0.14460481703281403, 'recall': 0.2137676626443863, 'f1': 0.18028776347637177}"", ""{'precision': 0.054828621447086334, 'recall': 0.1578940600156784, 'f1': 0.10728989541530609}"", ""{'precision': 0.3231819272041321, 'recall': 0.42914193868637085, 'f1': 0.3766500651836395}"", ""{'precision': 0.06238151714205742, 'recall': 0.07595311105251312, 'f1': 0.07067088782787323}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.040648944675922394, 'recall': 0.0014439028454944491, 'f1': 0.02255857363343239}"", ""{'precision': 0.33503711223602295, 'recall': 0.3662688434123993, 'f1': 0.3516627848148346}"", ""{'precision': -0.0808199793100357, 'recall': 0.04339419677853584, 'f1': -0.017838211730122566}"", ""{'precision': 0.17228850722312927, 'recall': 0.16112887859344482, 'f1': 0.16805635392665863}"", ""{'precision': 0.16065724194049835, 'recall': 0.2842628061771393, 'f1': 0.22298717498779297}"", ""{'precision': 0.19424818456172943, 'recall': 0.25405827164649963, 'f1': 0.22524210810661316}"", ""{'precision': 0.20658765733242035, 'recall': 0.1472964882850647, 'f1': 0.17810629308223724}"", ""{'precision': 0.02119770273566246, 'recall': 0.08223419636487961, 'f1': 0.0530717670917511}"", ""{'precision': 0.3092431426048279, 'recall': 0.23614603281021118, 'f1': 0.273618221282959}"", ""{'precision': 0.15373331308364868, 'recall': 0.1726284623146057, 'f1': 0.16452297568321228}"", ""{'precision': 0.1746618002653122, 'recall': 0.22373667359352112, 'f1': 0.20038409531116486}"", ""{'precision': 0.08880196511745453, 'recall': 0.07461851090192795, 'f1': 0.08319153636693954}"", ""{'precision': 0.1476742923259735, 'recall': 0.07884303480386734, 'f1': 0.11446332186460495}"", ""{'precision': -0.23309831321239471, 'recall': 0.09990908950567245, 'f1': -0.07053916156291962}"", ""{'precision': 0.03019283153116703, 'recall': 0.08091480284929276, 'f1': 0.05696043372154236}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.01413928988305, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.232914392851028, 0.288552621816469, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0777051775670442, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1016052632718472, 0.0, 0.1037397015701301, 0.0456987312059718, 0.0722312220036983, 0.1387480518647602, 0.0, 0.1161288667856411, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0851336600337967, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[5.666666666666667, 2.636363636363636, 2.789473684210526, 3.928571428571429, 6.714285714285714, 6.142857142857143, 7.0, 4.25, 1.4838709677419355, 1.0285714285714285, 2.789473684210526, 3.4, 3.0, 4.9, 5.8, 6.111111111111111, 2.5, 5.142857142857143, 1.5357142857142858, 2.652173913043478, 1.64, 1.1428571428571428, 6.888888888888889, 1.8484848484848484, 3.0, 5.714285714285714, 1.1, 2.909090909090909, 5.125, 2.6818181818181817]","[""{'precision': -0.09311841428279877, 'recall': -0.01294065173715353, 'f1': -0.051645345985889435}"", ""{'precision': 0.2109493762254715, 'recall': 0.20667512714862823, 'f1': 0.21009676158428192}"", ""{'precision': -0.02898159623146057, 'recall': 0.15586157143115997, 'f1': 0.0632597804069519}"", ""{'precision': 0.25616416335105896, 'recall': 0.3921296298503876, 'f1': 0.32437044382095337}"", ""{'precision': -0.03161277994513512, 'recall': 0.057851266115903854, 'f1': 0.014321071095764637}"", ""{'precision': -0.03530910238623619, 'recall': 0.05106435716152191, 'f1': 0.009115110151469707}"", ""{'precision': -0.35257774591445923, 'recall': -0.09080387651920319, 'f1': -0.22332797944545746}"", ""{'precision': 0.01716284081339836, 'recall': 0.16772548854351044, 'f1': 0.09279683977365494}"", ""{'precision': 0.3477271497249603, 'recall': 0.3651588559150696, 'f1': 0.35747477412223816}"", ""{'precision': 0.4063907563686371, 'recall': 0.23384788632392883, 'f1': 0.3198058307170868}"", ""{'precision': 0.09873276203870773, 'recall': 0.18228335678577423, 'f1': 0.14156284928321838}"", ""{'precision': 0.09469754993915558, 'recall': 0.19298988580703735, 'f1': 0.14476250112056732}"", ""{'precision': 0.32154300808906555, 'recall': 0.36767488718032837, 'f1': 0.345574289560318}"", ""{'precision': -0.08242210745811462, 'recall': 0.07026062160730362, 'f1': -0.005622691474854946}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.0636489987373352, 'recall': 0.29298919439315796, 'f1': 0.17709165811538696}"", ""{'precision': 0.32472991943359375, 'recall': 0.4210628569126129, 'f1': 0.37348079681396484}"", ""{'precision': 0.011358527466654778, 'recall': 0.052887097001075745, 'f1': 0.03360971808433533}"", ""{'precision': 0.17086820304393768, 'recall': 0.14884509146213531, 'f1': 0.16119760274887085}"", ""{'precision': 0.18676285445690155, 'recall': 0.2741827070713043, 'f1': 0.23135605454444885}"", ""{'precision': 0.01473683025687933, 'recall': 0.23198658227920532, 'f1': 0.1224624440073967}"", ""{'precision': 0.31424480676651, 'recall': 0.09978776425123215, 'f1': 0.2060675323009491}"", ""{'precision': -0.09696684777736664, 'recall': 0.08984457701444626, 'f1': -0.0036923084408044815}"", ""{'precision': 0.2577022612094879, 'recall': 0.20712047815322876, 'f1': 0.23353365063667297}"", ""{'precision': 0.04533824324607849, 'recall': 0.1415725201368332, 'f1': 0.09447082877159119}"", ""{'precision': 0.15169040858745575, 'recall': 0.21877674758434296, 'f1': 0.18633955717086792}"", ""{'precision': 0.09471594542264938, 'recall': 0.08893232047557831, 'f1': 0.09329762309789658}"", ""{'precision': 0.13611166179180145, 'recall': 0.09732230752706528, 'f1': 0.11807652562856674}"", ""{'precision': -0.1604962795972824, 'recall': 0.15840131044387817, 'f1': -0.00455790851265192}"", ""{'precision': 0.08433659374713898, 'recall': 0.07663544267416, 'f1': 0.08197701722383499}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1035056673507767, 0.0671608869518552, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2584050114622343, 0.3223659397724296, 0.138290599624506, 0.0, 0.1969509557508073, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0986639785766601, 0.0, 0.0018812325738725, 0.0822918270022972, 0.0246503920127183, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0802679530882732, 0.1523317510883013, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0576822277357025]","[3.9166666666666665, 3.636363636363636, 0.4736842105263157, 3.4285714285714284, 10.0, 4.285714285714286, 3.8, 2.5833333333333335, 1.3548387096774193, 0.8857142857142857, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7333333333333334, 2.4, 5.35, 11.0, 4.888888888888889, 2.9, 2.7142857142857144, 1.9642857142857144, 2.260869565217391, 2.0, 2.2857142857142856, 4.333333333333333, 2.060606060606061, 0.925925925925926, 5.0, 1.7666666666666666, 4.2727272727272725, 8.875, 1.5454545454545454]","[""{'precision': 0.018605075776576996, 'recall': 0.027676809579133987, 'f1': 0.024723809212446213}"", ""{'precision': 0.11408830434083939, 'recall': 0.12945179641246796, 'f1': 0.12318607419729233}"", ""{'precision': -0.044818583875894547, 'recall': 0.039317525923252106, 'f1': -0.0014776296447962523}"", ""{'precision': 0.28842395544052124, 'recall': 0.400706022977829, 'f1': 0.3450360596179962}"", ""{'precision': -0.05558670684695244, 'recall': 0.05271483585238457, 'f1': -0.00039977935375645757}"", ""{'precision': 0.16830281913280487, 'recall': 0.07726295292377472, 'f1': 0.12379739433526993}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.017596537247300148, 'recall': 0.0009918430587276816, 'f1': 0.010889396071434021}"", ""{'precision': 0.3915248215198517, 'recall': 0.3192733824253082, 'f1': 0.35619881749153137}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.22101496160030365, 'recall': 0.1334792971611023, 'f1': 0.17820799350738525}"", ""{'precision': 0.1150352880358696, 'recall': 0.19117280840873718, 'f1': 0.1541975736618042}"", ""{'precision': 0.40110504627227783, 'recall': 0.40135687589645386, 'f1': 0.4022037982940674}"", ""{'precision': -0.0658365860581398, 'recall': 0.0735541507601738, 'f1': 0.004498577211052179}"", ""{'precision': -0.07433929294347763, 'recall': -0.10522875189781189, 'f1': -0.08806341141462326}"", ""{'precision': 0.06748929619789124, 'recall': 0.10652444511651993, 'f1': 0.08841516077518463}"", ""{'precision': 0.3841123580932617, 'recall': 0.2892446517944336, 'f1': 0.3373279571533203}"", ""{'precision': 0.03829863667488098, 'recall': 0.039665237069129944, 'f1': 0.04054334759712219}"", ""{'precision': 0.0621151439845562, 'recall': 0.06140831857919693, 'f1': 0.06328627467155457}"", ""{'precision': 0.2234218567609787, 'recall': 0.2235700637102127, 'f1': 0.22475756704807281}"", ""{'precision': 0.09432080388069153, 'recall': 0.19741639494895935, 'f1': 0.14673668146133423}"", ""{'precision': 0.17018228769302368, 'recall': 0.17701993882656097, 'f1': 0.17494195699691772}"", ""{'precision': -0.05711100995540619, 'recall': 0.15987704694271088, 'f1': 0.05057244002819061}"", ""{'precision': 0.1795092225074768, 'recall': 0.22820739448070526, 'f1': 0.20503807067871094}"", ""{'precision': 0.17392954230308533, 'recall': 0.1660403460264206, 'f1': 0.17133016884326935}"", ""{'precision': 0.24478335678577423, 'recall': 0.23942787945270538, 'f1': 0.2433353066444397}"", ""{'precision': 0.051276274025440216, 'recall': 0.03819303587079048, 'f1': 0.04627799242734909}"", ""{'precision': 0.0014669972006231546, 'recall': 0.09220745414495468, 'f1': 0.04797528684139252}"", ""{'precision': -0.14923645555973053, 'recall': 0.13711276650428772, 'f1': -0.008572653867304325}"", ""{'precision': 0.06578033417463303, 'recall': 0.1044427752494812, 'f1': 0.08652433007955551}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use (with examples): ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Format your answer as follows: (Teaching Method) (Response) Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.280274337093472, 0.0595901505578131, 0.0634508564975691, 0.0, 0.1072481046120325, 0.2331032305449905, 0.1887971609447683, 0.4482468976384072, 0.218167631398606, 0.2372445311148961, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1737546155282429, 0.1121535111154828, 0.1455629308592705, 0.2691694521503486, 0.0387265856899321, 0.1543118895803178, 0.1429861229229596, 0.2223921435844164, 0.1244109327523227, 0.0, 0.1376201412853196, 0.0359484198870081, 0.0885679996609688, 0.1497610494494438]","[2.4166666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 1.7142857142857142, 1.8571428571428572, 2.142857142857143, 2.4, 1.5833333333333333, 0.8064516129032258, 0.3714285714285714, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 3.0, 1.8888888888888888, 1.7, 2.4285714285714284, 1.1071428571428572, 0.9130434782608696, 0.56, 1.4285714285714286, 0.7777777777777778, 0.8181818181818182, 1.2592592592592593, 1.8571428571428572, 0.5333333333333333, 2.090909090909091, 1.875, 0.9090909090909092]","[""{'precision': 0.13864237070083618, 'recall': 0.22377946972846985, 'f1': 0.18218955397605896}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.29420068860054016, 'recall': 0.45664507150650024, 'f1': 0.37520068883895874}"", ""{'precision': 0.13351726531982422, 'recall': 0.29529616236686707, 'f1': 0.21441839635372162}"", ""{'precision': 0.29231661558151245, 'recall': 0.2771975100040436, 'f1': 0.28590792417526245}"", ""{'precision': -0.16725677251815796, 'recall': -0.02978040836751461, 'f1': -0.09770578891038895}"", ""{'precision': 0.218782439827919, 'recall': 0.24108827114105225, 'f1': 0.2311628758907318}"", ""{'precision': 0.24765720963478088, 'recall': 0.2681216597557068, 'f1': 0.25907573103904724}"", ""{'precision': 0.17579273879528046, 'recall': 0.0702231302857399, 'f1': 0.12388003617525101}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.08622314035892487, 'recall': 0.32667577266693115, 'f1': 0.2049374133348465}"", ""{'precision': 0.25753599405288696, 'recall': 0.3161171078681946, 'f1': 0.2878223955631256}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.13379955291748047, 'recall': 0.09721406549215317, 'f1': 0.11687683314085007}"", ""{'precision': 0.015880854800343513, 'recall': 0.0830654427409172, 'f1': 0.05079316720366478}"", ""{'precision': 0.23008720576763153, 'recall': 0.4026769995689392, 'f1': 0.31608065962791443}"", ""{'precision': 0.296329528093338, 'recall': 0.46848103404045105, 'f1': 0.38202130794525146}"", ""{'precision': 0.12538881599903107, 'recall': 0.12354177236557007, 'f1': 0.12588776648044586}"", ""{'precision': 0.3607337772846222, 'recall': 0.31556951999664307, 'f1': 0.33912941813468933}"", ""{'precision': -0.07983797043561935, 'recall': 0.057360295206308365, 'f1': -0.010546828620135784}"", ""{'precision': 0.31597214937210083, 'recall': 0.2876557409763336, 'f1': 0.3029094934463501}"", ""{'precision': 0.09233592450618744, 'recall': 0.2008637934923172, 'f1': 0.14741015434265137}"", ""{'precision': 0.22945044934749603, 'recall': 0.2754858434200287, 'f1': 0.2535819411277771}"", ""{'precision': 0.1828542798757553, 'recall': 0.2094971388578415, 'f1': 0.19744791090488434}"", ""{'precision': 0.10266786813735962, 'recall': 0.19699440896511078, 'f1': 0.1507779061794281}"", ""{'precision': 0.10981395095586777, 'recall': 0.047144029289484024, 'f1': 0.07977928966283798}"", ""{'precision': 0.09698135405778885, 'recall': 0.290243923664093, 'f1': 0.1931089609861374}"", ""{'precision': 0.07298797369003296, 'recall': 0.2475324124097824, 'f1': 0.16013599932193756}"", ""{'precision': 0.09527769684791565, 'recall': 0.10083868354558945, 'f1': 0.09952209889888763}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.0602024057870188, 0.0369230996710913, 0.0334222354874107, 0.0, 0.0172822121316674, 0.2822177794147447, 0.1264396151914723, 0.4482468976384072, 0.2166361496557471, 0.2112315144141515, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1458772459155634, 0.0484547153022719, 0.0976198112765639, 0.1287198804729226, 0.0252047787261781, 0.0963881797449929, 0.0319340280246817, 0.2765885904901324, 0.0176132574100486, 0.0, 0.1542999093435335, 0.2538067443387491, 0.0, 0.1461071665346364]","[2.1666666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 2.7142857142857144, 1.7142857142857142, 2.142857142857143, 1.4, 1.3333333333333333, 0.3870967741935484, 0.6285714285714286, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 4.8, 1.5555555555555556, 2.7, 2.142857142857143, 0.6071428571428571, 1.608695652173913, 1.2, 1.7857142857142858, 1.1111111111111112, 0.4545454545454545, 1.4074074074074074, 3.2857142857142856, 0.5333333333333333, 1.3636363636363635, 5.125, 0.8181818181818182]","[""{'precision': 0.11144650727510452, 'recall': 0.16678740084171295, 'f1': 0.1403663456439972}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.16733106970787048, 'recall': 0.34498879313468933, 'f1': 0.2558545470237732}"", ""{'precision': 0.14777971804141998, 'recall': 0.12287995219230652, 'f1': 0.13670334219932556}"", ""{'precision': 0.14047302305698395, 'recall': 0.16943396627902985, 'f1': 0.15628546476364136}"", ""{'precision': -0.1741969883441925, 'recall': -0.2152625024318695, 'f1': -0.19287870824337006}"", ""{'precision': 0.10095961391925812, 'recall': -0.010690257884562016, 'f1': 0.04605867713689804}"", ""{'precision': 0.4403025507926941, 'recall': 0.15784242749214172, 'f1': 0.29640036821365356}"", ""{'precision': 0.1082160696387291, 'recall': -0.02357855811715126, 'f1': 0.043000295758247375}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.0672667920589447, 'recall': 0.34117069840431213, 'f1': 0.20187444984912872}"", ""{'precision': 0.21142058074474335, 'recall': 0.2578919529914856, 'f1': 0.23579636216163635}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.07662168145179749, 'recall': -0.05927005410194397, 'f1': 0.00935102254152298}"", ""{'precision': -0.02370366081595421, 'recall': -0.02631603181362152, 'f1': -0.02334471233189106}"", ""{'precision': 0.3802837133407593, 'recall': 0.37594321370124817, 'f1': 0.37912291288375854}"", ""{'precision': 0.22057241201400757, 'recall': 0.2892892360687256, 'f1': 0.25591564178466797}"", ""{'precision': 0.13475148379802704, 'recall': -0.040554143488407135, 'f1': 0.047102976590394974}"", ""{'precision': 0.2246946543455124, 'recall': 0.10567621141672134, 'f1': 0.16584555804729462}"", ""{'precision': -0.022776130586862564, 'recall': 0.083047054708004, 'f1': 0.031150298193097115}"", ""{'precision': 0.2631351351737976, 'recall': 0.2743387222290039, 'f1': 0.269919216632843}"", ""{'precision': -0.08870362490415573, 'recall': 0.10129321366548538, 'f1': 0.006090278271585703}"", ""{'precision': 0.42749470472335815, 'recall': 0.1397526115179062, 'f1': 0.28082096576690674}"", ""{'precision': 0.06014829874038696, 'recall': 0.12220893800258636, 'f1': 0.09246557205915451}"", ""{'precision': 0.2430046945810318, 'recall': 0.3270018994808197, 'f1': 0.2858295142650604}"", ""{'precision': 0.14836622774600983, 'recall': 0.00877873133867979, 'f1': 0.07909627258777618}"", ""{'precision': 0.2596312463283539, 'recall': 0.2833509147167206, 'f1': 0.2726484537124634}"", ""{'precision': -0.04212549328804016, 'recall': 0.2262428104877472, 'f1': 0.0899641290307045}"", ""{'precision': 0.13963252305984497, 'recall': 0.06494591385126114, 'f1': 0.10346974432468414}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  Directly answer the student's question.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.1387281377207149, 0.0326287712524776, 0.0931273669314074, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3685939814893283, 0.3223659397724296, 0.2835382546816534, 0.0353186986044697, 0.2098288242723427, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1303345371663271, 0.1411195762450153, 0.2307743706703186, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1447803716874165, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0144460941817118, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.0833333333333335, 1.6363636363636365, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7857142857142856, 5.142857142857143, 8.285714285714286, 3.8, 3.6666666666666665, 0.7741935483870968, 0.8857142857142857, 1.2105263157894737, 2.0, 2.3333333333333335, 2.75, 6.8, 6.888888888888889, 3.7, 5.571428571428571, 0.9642857142857144, 1.6521739130434785, 0.92, 3.2857142857142856, 5.111111111111111, 1.4848484848484849, 2.2222222222222223, 4.571428571428571, 1.3666666666666667, 2.727272727272727, 8.75, 2.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.11432495713233948, 'recall': 0.03324726223945618, 'f1': 0.07496145367622375}"", ""{'precision': 0.34705960750579834, 'recall': 0.16323672235012054, 'f1': 0.2547290027141571}"", ""{'precision': -0.04055697098374367, 'recall': 0.13544459640979767, 'f1': 0.047443777322769165}"", ""{'precision': 0.2874433696269989, 'recall': 0.3909418284893036, 'f1': 0.33976122736930847}"", ""{'precision': 0.013704590499401093, 'recall': 0.1261105239391327, 'f1': 0.07079096138477325}"", ""{'precision': 0.0022958312183618546, 'recall': 0.0070695350877940655, 'f1': 0.006298996973782778}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.04759303852915764, 'recall': 0.14297078549861908, 'f1': 0.09630267322063446}"", ""{'precision': 0.5061132907867432, 'recall': 0.3179398477077484, 'f1': 0.4113249182701111}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.3297567069530487, 'recall': 0.20683324337005615, 'f1': 0.268756240606308}"", ""{'precision': 0.0749378353357315, 'recall': 0.11573436856269836, 'f1': 0.09672435373067856}"", ""{'precision': 0.4073179364204407, 'recall': 0.39869120717048645, 'f1': 0.4039713740348816}"", ""{'precision': -0.009095241315662861, 'recall': 0.020507877692580223, 'f1': 0.007277961820363998}"", ""{'precision': -0.06473217904567719, 'recall': -0.034142181277275085, 'f1': -0.047779280692338943}"", ""{'precision': -0.04261331260204315, 'recall': 0.1446707844734192, 'f1': 0.050818946212530136}"", ""{'precision': 0.3305618166923523, 'recall': 0.26773256063461304, 'f1': 0.30009621381759644}"", ""{'precision': -0.031261153519153595, 'recall': 0.018836529925465584, 'f1': -0.004703410901129246}"", ""{'precision': 0.15156836807727814, 'recall': 0.07251915335655212, 'f1': 0.11317533999681473}"", ""{'precision': 0.22911085188388824, 'recall': 0.17426548898220062, 'f1': 0.20283786952495575}"", ""{'precision': 0.24250556528568268, 'recall': 0.2621985375881195, 'f1': 0.2535487413406372}"", ""{'precision': 0.19026708602905273, 'recall': 0.1819763332605362, 'f1': 0.18744036555290222}"", ""{'precision': -0.07508712261915207, 'recall': 0.037153083831071854, 'f1': -0.017948396503925323}"", ""{'precision': 0.2166709154844284, 'recall': 0.17746104300022125, 'f1': 0.19829514622688293}"", ""{'precision': 0.07609530538320541, 'recall': 0.12819607555866241, 'f1': 0.10347115993499756}"", ""{'precision': 0.23566016554832458, 'recall': 0.2002030313014984, 'f1': 0.2191401720046997}"", ""{'precision': 0.039474498480558395, 'recall': 0.03034212253987789, 'f1': 0.03647209703922272}"", ""{'precision': 0.17368051409721375, 'recall': 0.15962590277194977, 'f1': 0.16799703240394592}"", ""{'precision': -0.06723884493112564, 'recall': 0.22073249518871307, 'f1': 0.07412375509738922}"", ""{'precision': 0.13290952146053314, 'recall': 0.07355167716741562, 'f1': 0.1045115739107132}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1231552158867506, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1595867466221573, 0.2816988029230364, 0.0375123027908174, 0.0, 0.121658365925153, 0.0026883850904072, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1601171066931316, 0.0, 0.118127981268613, 0.023413470249148, 0.1743353397675923, 0.017465844953817, 0.0, 0.1669695384489661, 0.1627683104536919, 0.0, 0.0606433872310888, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.1666666666666665, 3.8181818181818183, 1.105263157894737, 4.357142857142857, 8.142857142857142, 8.285714285714286, 6.2, 3.6666666666666665, 1.903225806451613, 1.0285714285714285, 2.5789473684210527, 4.0, 2.8666666666666667, 2.15, 5.8, 4.333333333333333, 2.3, 6.714285714285714, 1.5357142857142858, 2.869565217391304, 1.24, 2.0714285714285716, 3.111111111111111, 1.5454545454545454, 1.037037037037037, 4.714285714285714, 1.2666666666666666, 2.4545454545454546, 2.25, 3.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.10684812068939209, 'recall': 0.03631405159831047, 'f1': 0.07283965498209}"", ""{'precision': 0.18081633746623993, 'recall': 0.21930274367332458, 'f1': 0.20128819346427917}"", ""{'precision': 0.17166095972061157, 'recall': 0.13189461827278137, 'f1': 0.15307734906673431}"", ""{'precision': 0.2035761922597885, 'recall': 0.36162516474723816, 'f1': 0.28257477283477783}"", ""{'precision': -0.007911596447229385, 'recall': 0.07360721379518509, 'f1': 0.03408719226717949}"", ""{'precision': -0.029209056869149208, 'recall': -0.0254511758685112, 'f1': -0.025661807507276535}"", ""{'precision': -0.28529930114746094, 'recall': -0.1471974402666092, 'f1': -0.21527764201164246}"", ""{'precision': 0.06908895075321198, 'recall': 0.19120818376541138, 'f1': 0.1308295577764511}"", ""{'precision': 0.24328982830047607, 'recall': 0.3773156702518463, 'f1': 0.3105713427066803}"", ""{'precision': 0.37962114810943604, 'recall': 0.23239125311374664, 'f1': 0.30609819293022156}"", ""{'precision': 0.14460481703281403, 'recall': 0.2137676626443863, 'f1': 0.18028776347637177}"", ""{'precision': 0.054828621447086334, 'recall': 0.1578940600156784, 'f1': 0.10728989541530609}"", ""{'precision': 0.3231819272041321, 'recall': 0.42914193868637085, 'f1': 0.3766500651836395}"", ""{'precision': 0.06238151714205742, 'recall': 0.07595311105251312, 'f1': 0.07067088782787323}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.040648944675922394, 'recall': 0.0014439028454944491, 'f1': 0.02255857363343239}"", ""{'precision': 0.33503711223602295, 'recall': 0.3662688434123993, 'f1': 0.3516627848148346}"", ""{'precision': -0.0808199793100357, 'recall': 0.04339419677853584, 'f1': -0.017838211730122566}"", ""{'precision': 0.17228850722312927, 'recall': 0.16112887859344482, 'f1': 0.16805635392665863}"", ""{'precision': 0.16065724194049835, 'recall': 0.2842628061771393, 'f1': 0.22298717498779297}"", ""{'precision': 0.19424818456172943, 'recall': 0.25405827164649963, 'f1': 0.22524210810661316}"", ""{'precision': 0.20658765733242035, 'recall': 0.1472964882850647, 'f1': 0.17810629308223724}"", ""{'precision': 0.02119770273566246, 'recall': 0.08223419636487961, 'f1': 0.0530717670917511}"", ""{'precision': 0.3092431426048279, 'recall': 0.23614603281021118, 'f1': 0.273618221282959}"", ""{'precision': 0.15373331308364868, 'recall': 0.1726284623146057, 'f1': 0.16452297568321228}"", ""{'precision': 0.1746618002653122, 'recall': 0.22373667359352112, 'f1': 0.20038409531116486}"", ""{'precision': 0.08880196511745453, 'recall': 0.07461851090192795, 'f1': 0.08319153636693954}"", ""{'precision': 0.1476742923259735, 'recall': 0.07884303480386734, 'f1': 0.11446332186460495}"", ""{'precision': -0.23309831321239471, 'recall': 0.09990908950567245, 'f1': -0.07053916156291962}"", ""{'precision': 0.03019283153116703, 'recall': 0.08091480284929276, 'f1': 0.05696043372154236}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.01413928988305, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.232914392851028, 0.288552621816469, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0777051775670442, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1016052632718472, 0.0, 0.1037397015701301, 0.0456987312059718, 0.0722312220036983, 0.1387480518647602, 0.0, 0.1161288667856411, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0851336600337967, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[5.666666666666667, 2.636363636363636, 2.789473684210526, 3.928571428571429, 6.714285714285714, 6.142857142857143, 7.0, 4.25, 1.4838709677419355, 1.0285714285714285, 2.789473684210526, 3.4, 3.0, 4.9, 5.8, 6.111111111111111, 2.5, 5.142857142857143, 1.5357142857142858, 2.652173913043478, 1.64, 1.1428571428571428, 6.888888888888889, 1.8484848484848484, 3.0, 5.714285714285714, 1.1, 2.909090909090909, 5.125, 2.6818181818181817]","[""{'precision': -0.09311841428279877, 'recall': -0.01294065173715353, 'f1': -0.051645345985889435}"", ""{'precision': 0.2109493762254715, 'recall': 0.20667512714862823, 'f1': 0.21009676158428192}"", ""{'precision': -0.02898159623146057, 'recall': 0.15586157143115997, 'f1': 0.0632597804069519}"", ""{'precision': 0.25616416335105896, 'recall': 0.3921296298503876, 'f1': 0.32437044382095337}"", ""{'precision': -0.03161277994513512, 'recall': 0.057851266115903854, 'f1': 0.014321071095764637}"", ""{'precision': -0.03530910238623619, 'recall': 0.05106435716152191, 'f1': 0.009115110151469707}"", ""{'precision': -0.35257774591445923, 'recall': -0.09080387651920319, 'f1': -0.22332797944545746}"", ""{'precision': 0.01716284081339836, 'recall': 0.16772548854351044, 'f1': 0.09279683977365494}"", ""{'precision': 0.3477271497249603, 'recall': 0.3651588559150696, 'f1': 0.35747477412223816}"", ""{'precision': 0.4063907563686371, 'recall': 0.23384788632392883, 'f1': 0.3198058307170868}"", ""{'precision': 0.09873276203870773, 'recall': 0.18228335678577423, 'f1': 0.14156284928321838}"", ""{'precision': 0.09469754993915558, 'recall': 0.19298988580703735, 'f1': 0.14476250112056732}"", ""{'precision': 0.32154300808906555, 'recall': 0.36767488718032837, 'f1': 0.345574289560318}"", ""{'precision': -0.08242210745811462, 'recall': 0.07026062160730362, 'f1': -0.005622691474854946}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.0636489987373352, 'recall': 0.29298919439315796, 'f1': 0.17709165811538696}"", ""{'precision': 0.32472991943359375, 'recall': 0.4210628569126129, 'f1': 0.37348079681396484}"", ""{'precision': 0.011358527466654778, 'recall': 0.052887097001075745, 'f1': 0.03360971808433533}"", ""{'precision': 0.17086820304393768, 'recall': 0.14884509146213531, 'f1': 0.16119760274887085}"", ""{'precision': 0.18676285445690155, 'recall': 0.2741827070713043, 'f1': 0.23135605454444885}"", ""{'precision': 0.01473683025687933, 'recall': 0.23198658227920532, 'f1': 0.1224624440073967}"", ""{'precision': 0.31424480676651, 'recall': 0.09978776425123215, 'f1': 0.2060675323009491}"", ""{'precision': -0.09696684777736664, 'recall': 0.08984457701444626, 'f1': -0.0036923084408044815}"", ""{'precision': 0.2577022612094879, 'recall': 0.20712047815322876, 'f1': 0.23353365063667297}"", ""{'precision': 0.04533824324607849, 'recall': 0.1415725201368332, 'f1': 0.09447082877159119}"", ""{'precision': 0.15169040858745575, 'recall': 0.21877674758434296, 'f1': 0.18633955717086792}"", ""{'precision': 0.09471594542264938, 'recall': 0.08893232047557831, 'f1': 0.09329762309789658}"", ""{'precision': 0.13611166179180145, 'recall': 0.09732230752706528, 'f1': 0.11807652562856674}"", ""{'precision': -0.1604962795972824, 'recall': 0.15840131044387817, 'f1': -0.00455790851265192}"", ""{'precision': 0.08433659374713898, 'recall': 0.07663544267416, 'f1': 0.08197701722383499}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1035056673507767, 0.0671608869518552, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2584050114622343, 0.3223659397724296, 0.138290599624506, 0.0, 0.1969509557508073, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0986639785766601, 0.0, 0.0018812325738725, 0.0822918270022972, 0.0246503920127183, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0802679530882732, 0.1523317510883013, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0576822277357025]","[3.9166666666666665, 3.636363636363636, 0.4736842105263157, 3.4285714285714284, 10.0, 4.285714285714286, 3.8, 2.5833333333333335, 1.3548387096774193, 0.8857142857142857, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7333333333333334, 2.4, 5.35, 11.0, 4.888888888888889, 2.9, 2.7142857142857144, 1.9642857142857144, 2.260869565217391, 2.0, 2.2857142857142856, 4.333333333333333, 2.060606060606061, 0.925925925925926, 5.0, 1.7666666666666666, 4.2727272727272725, 8.875, 1.5454545454545454]","[""{'precision': 0.018605075776576996, 'recall': 0.027676809579133987, 'f1': 0.024723809212446213}"", ""{'precision': 0.11408830434083939, 'recall': 0.12945179641246796, 'f1': 0.12318607419729233}"", ""{'precision': -0.044818583875894547, 'recall': 0.039317525923252106, 'f1': -0.0014776296447962523}"", ""{'precision': 0.28842395544052124, 'recall': 0.400706022977829, 'f1': 0.3450360596179962}"", ""{'precision': -0.05558670684695244, 'recall': 0.05271483585238457, 'f1': -0.00039977935375645757}"", ""{'precision': 0.16830281913280487, 'recall': 0.07726295292377472, 'f1': 0.12379739433526993}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.017596537247300148, 'recall': 0.0009918430587276816, 'f1': 0.010889396071434021}"", ""{'precision': 0.3915248215198517, 'recall': 0.3192733824253082, 'f1': 0.35619881749153137}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.22101496160030365, 'recall': 0.1334792971611023, 'f1': 0.17820799350738525}"", ""{'precision': 0.1150352880358696, 'recall': 0.19117280840873718, 'f1': 0.1541975736618042}"", ""{'precision': 0.40110504627227783, 'recall': 0.40135687589645386, 'f1': 0.4022037982940674}"", ""{'precision': -0.0658365860581398, 'recall': 0.0735541507601738, 'f1': 0.004498577211052179}"", ""{'precision': -0.07433929294347763, 'recall': -0.10522875189781189, 'f1': -0.08806341141462326}"", ""{'precision': 0.06748929619789124, 'recall': 0.10652444511651993, 'f1': 0.08841516077518463}"", ""{'precision': 0.3841123580932617, 'recall': 0.2892446517944336, 'f1': 0.3373279571533203}"", ""{'precision': 0.03829863667488098, 'recall': 0.039665237069129944, 'f1': 0.04054334759712219}"", ""{'precision': 0.0621151439845562, 'recall': 0.06140831857919693, 'f1': 0.06328627467155457}"", ""{'precision': 0.2234218567609787, 'recall': 0.2235700637102127, 'f1': 0.22475756704807281}"", ""{'precision': 0.09432080388069153, 'recall': 0.19741639494895935, 'f1': 0.14673668146133423}"", ""{'precision': 0.17018228769302368, 'recall': 0.17701993882656097, 'f1': 0.17494195699691772}"", ""{'precision': -0.05711100995540619, 'recall': 0.15987704694271088, 'f1': 0.05057244002819061}"", ""{'precision': 0.1795092225074768, 'recall': 0.22820739448070526, 'f1': 0.20503807067871094}"", ""{'precision': 0.17392954230308533, 'recall': 0.1660403460264206, 'f1': 0.17133016884326935}"", ""{'precision': 0.24478335678577423, 'recall': 0.23942787945270538, 'f1': 0.2433353066444397}"", ""{'precision': 0.051276274025440216, 'recall': 0.03819303587079048, 'f1': 0.04627799242734909}"", ""{'precision': 0.0014669972006231546, 'recall': 0.09220745414495468, 'f1': 0.04797528684139252}"", ""{'precision': -0.14923645555973053, 'recall': 0.13711276650428772, 'f1': -0.008572653867304325}"", ""{'precision': 0.06578033417463303, 'recall': 0.1044427752494812, 'f1': 0.08652433007955551}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use (with examples): ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Format your answer as follows: (Teaching Method) (Response) Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.280274337093472, 0.0595901505578131, 0.0634508564975691, 0.0, 0.1072481046120325, 0.2331032305449905, 0.1887971609447683, 0.4482468976384072, 0.218167631398606, 0.2372445311148961, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1737546155282429, 0.1121535111154828, 0.1455629308592705, 0.2691694521503486, 0.0387265856899321, 0.1543118895803178, 0.1429861229229596, 0.2223921435844164, 0.1244109327523227, 0.0, 0.1376201412853196, 0.0359484198870081, 0.0885679996609688, 0.1497610494494438]","[2.4166666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 1.7142857142857142, 1.8571428571428572, 2.142857142857143, 2.4, 1.5833333333333333, 0.8064516129032258, 0.3714285714285714, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 3.0, 1.8888888888888888, 1.7, 2.4285714285714284, 1.1071428571428572, 0.9130434782608696, 0.56, 1.4285714285714286, 0.7777777777777778, 0.8181818181818182, 1.2592592592592593, 1.8571428571428572, 0.5333333333333333, 2.090909090909091, 1.875, 0.9090909090909092]","[""{'precision': 0.13864237070083618, 'recall': 0.22377946972846985, 'f1': 0.18218955397605896}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.29420068860054016, 'recall': 0.45664507150650024, 'f1': 0.37520068883895874}"", ""{'precision': 0.13351726531982422, 'recall': 0.29529616236686707, 'f1': 0.21441839635372162}"", ""{'precision': 0.29231661558151245, 'recall': 0.2771975100040436, 'f1': 0.28590792417526245}"", ""{'precision': -0.16725677251815796, 'recall': -0.02978040836751461, 'f1': -0.09770578891038895}"", ""{'precision': 0.218782439827919, 'recall': 0.24108827114105225, 'f1': 0.2311628758907318}"", ""{'precision': 0.24765720963478088, 'recall': 0.2681216597557068, 'f1': 0.25907573103904724}"", ""{'precision': 0.17579273879528046, 'recall': 0.0702231302857399, 'f1': 0.12388003617525101}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.08622314035892487, 'recall': 0.32667577266693115, 'f1': 0.2049374133348465}"", ""{'precision': 0.25753599405288696, 'recall': 0.3161171078681946, 'f1': 0.2878223955631256}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.13379955291748047, 'recall': 0.09721406549215317, 'f1': 0.11687683314085007}"", ""{'precision': 0.015880854800343513, 'recall': 0.0830654427409172, 'f1': 0.05079316720366478}"", ""{'precision': 0.23008720576763153, 'recall': 0.4026769995689392, 'f1': 0.31608065962791443}"", ""{'precision': 0.296329528093338, 'recall': 0.46848103404045105, 'f1': 0.38202130794525146}"", ""{'precision': 0.12538881599903107, 'recall': 0.12354177236557007, 'f1': 0.12588776648044586}"", ""{'precision': 0.3607337772846222, 'recall': 0.31556951999664307, 'f1': 0.33912941813468933}"", ""{'precision': -0.07983797043561935, 'recall': 0.057360295206308365, 'f1': -0.010546828620135784}"", ""{'precision': 0.31597214937210083, 'recall': 0.2876557409763336, 'f1': 0.3029094934463501}"", ""{'precision': 0.09233592450618744, 'recall': 0.2008637934923172, 'f1': 0.14741015434265137}"", ""{'precision': 0.22945044934749603, 'recall': 0.2754858434200287, 'f1': 0.2535819411277771}"", ""{'precision': 0.1828542798757553, 'recall': 0.2094971388578415, 'f1': 0.19744791090488434}"", ""{'precision': 0.10266786813735962, 'recall': 0.19699440896511078, 'f1': 0.1507779061794281}"", ""{'precision': 0.10981395095586777, 'recall': 0.047144029289484024, 'f1': 0.07977928966283798}"", ""{'precision': 0.09698135405778885, 'recall': 0.290243923664093, 'f1': 0.1931089609861374}"", ""{'precision': 0.07298797369003296, 'recall': 0.2475324124097824, 'f1': 0.16013599932193756}"", ""{'precision': 0.09527769684791565, 'recall': 0.10083868354558945, 'f1': 0.09952209889888763}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.0602024057870188, 0.0369230996710913, 0.0334222354874107, 0.0, 0.0172822121316674, 0.2822177794147447, 0.1264396151914723, 0.4482468976384072, 0.2166361496557471, 0.2112315144141515, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1458772459155634, 0.0484547153022719, 0.0976198112765639, 0.1287198804729226, 0.0252047787261781, 0.0963881797449929, 0.0319340280246817, 0.2765885904901324, 0.0176132574100486, 0.0, 0.1542999093435335, 0.2538067443387491, 0.0, 0.1461071665346364]","[2.1666666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 2.7142857142857144, 1.7142857142857142, 2.142857142857143, 1.4, 1.3333333333333333, 0.3870967741935484, 0.6285714285714286, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 4.8, 1.5555555555555556, 2.7, 2.142857142857143, 0.6071428571428571, 1.608695652173913, 1.2, 1.7857142857142858, 1.1111111111111112, 0.4545454545454545, 1.4074074074074074, 3.2857142857142856, 0.5333333333333333, 1.3636363636363635, 5.125, 0.8181818181818182]","[""{'precision': 0.11144650727510452, 'recall': 0.16678740084171295, 'f1': 0.1403663456439972}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.16733106970787048, 'recall': 0.34498879313468933, 'f1': 0.2558545470237732}"", ""{'precision': 0.14777971804141998, 'recall': 0.12287995219230652, 'f1': 0.13670334219932556}"", ""{'precision': 0.14047302305698395, 'recall': 0.16943396627902985, 'f1': 0.15628546476364136}"", ""{'precision': -0.1741969883441925, 'recall': -0.2152625024318695, 'f1': -0.19287870824337006}"", ""{'precision': 0.10095961391925812, 'recall': -0.010690257884562016, 'f1': 0.04605867713689804}"", ""{'precision': 0.4403025507926941, 'recall': 0.15784242749214172, 'f1': 0.29640036821365356}"", ""{'precision': 0.1082160696387291, 'recall': -0.02357855811715126, 'f1': 0.043000295758247375}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.0672667920589447, 'recall': 0.34117069840431213, 'f1': 0.20187444984912872}"", ""{'precision': 0.21142058074474335, 'recall': 0.2578919529914856, 'f1': 0.23579636216163635}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.07662168145179749, 'recall': -0.05927005410194397, 'f1': 0.00935102254152298}"", ""{'precision': -0.02370366081595421, 'recall': -0.02631603181362152, 'f1': -0.02334471233189106}"", ""{'precision': 0.3802837133407593, 'recall': 0.37594321370124817, 'f1': 0.37912291288375854}"", ""{'precision': 0.22057241201400757, 'recall': 0.2892892360687256, 'f1': 0.25591564178466797}"", ""{'precision': 0.13475148379802704, 'recall': -0.040554143488407135, 'f1': 0.047102976590394974}"", ""{'precision': 0.2246946543455124, 'recall': 0.10567621141672134, 'f1': 0.16584555804729462}"", ""{'precision': -0.022776130586862564, 'recall': 0.083047054708004, 'f1': 0.031150298193097115}"", ""{'precision': 0.2631351351737976, 'recall': 0.2743387222290039, 'f1': 0.269919216632843}"", ""{'precision': -0.08870362490415573, 'recall': 0.10129321366548538, 'f1': 0.006090278271585703}"", ""{'precision': 0.42749470472335815, 'recall': 0.1397526115179062, 'f1': 0.28082096576690674}"", ""{'precision': 0.06014829874038696, 'recall': 0.12220893800258636, 'f1': 0.09246557205915451}"", ""{'precision': 0.2430046945810318, 'recall': 0.3270018994808197, 'f1': 0.2858295142650604}"", ""{'precision': 0.14836622774600983, 'recall': 0.00877873133867979, 'f1': 0.07909627258777618}"", ""{'precision': 0.2596312463283539, 'recall': 0.2833509147167206, 'f1': 0.2726484537124634}"", ""{'precision': -0.04212549328804016, 'recall': 0.2262428104877472, 'f1': 0.0899641290307045}"", ""{'precision': 0.13963252305984497, 'recall': 0.06494591385126114, 'f1': 0.10346974432468414}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  Directly answer the student's question.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.1387281377207149, 0.0326287712524776, 0.0931273669314074, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3685939814893283, 0.3223659397724296, 0.2835382546816534, 0.0353186986044697, 0.2098288242723427, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1303345371663271, 0.1411195762450153, 0.2307743706703186, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1447803716874165, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0144460941817118, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.0833333333333335, 1.6363636363636365, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7857142857142856, 5.142857142857143, 8.285714285714286, 3.8, 3.6666666666666665, 0.7741935483870968, 0.8857142857142857, 1.2105263157894737, 2.0, 2.3333333333333335, 2.75, 6.8, 6.888888888888889, 3.7, 5.571428571428571, 0.9642857142857144, 1.6521739130434785, 0.92, 3.2857142857142856, 5.111111111111111, 1.4848484848484849, 2.2222222222222223, 4.571428571428571, 1.3666666666666667, 2.727272727272727, 8.75, 2.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.11432495713233948, 'recall': 0.03324726223945618, 'f1': 0.07496145367622375}"", ""{'precision': 0.34705960750579834, 'recall': 0.16323672235012054, 'f1': 0.2547290027141571}"", ""{'precision': -0.04055697098374367, 'recall': 0.13544459640979767, 'f1': 0.047443777322769165}"", ""{'precision': 0.2874433696269989, 'recall': 0.3909418284893036, 'f1': 0.33976122736930847}"", ""{'precision': 0.013704590499401093, 'recall': 0.1261105239391327, 'f1': 0.07079096138477325}"", ""{'precision': 0.0022958312183618546, 'recall': 0.0070695350877940655, 'f1': 0.006298996973782778}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.04759303852915764, 'recall': 0.14297078549861908, 'f1': 0.09630267322063446}"", ""{'precision': 0.5061132907867432, 'recall': 0.3179398477077484, 'f1': 0.4113249182701111}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.3297567069530487, 'recall': 0.20683324337005615, 'f1': 0.268756240606308}"", ""{'precision': 0.0749378353357315, 'recall': 0.11573436856269836, 'f1': 0.09672435373067856}"", ""{'precision': 0.4073179364204407, 'recall': 0.39869120717048645, 'f1': 0.4039713740348816}"", ""{'precision': -0.009095241315662861, 'recall': 0.020507877692580223, 'f1': 0.007277961820363998}"", ""{'precision': -0.06473217904567719, 'recall': -0.034142181277275085, 'f1': -0.047779280692338943}"", ""{'precision': -0.04261331260204315, 'recall': 0.1446707844734192, 'f1': 0.050818946212530136}"", ""{'precision': 0.3305618166923523, 'recall': 0.26773256063461304, 'f1': 0.30009621381759644}"", ""{'precision': -0.031261153519153595, 'recall': 0.018836529925465584, 'f1': -0.004703410901129246}"", ""{'precision': 0.15156836807727814, 'recall': 0.07251915335655212, 'f1': 0.11317533999681473}"", ""{'precision': 0.22911085188388824, 'recall': 0.17426548898220062, 'f1': 0.20283786952495575}"", ""{'precision': 0.24250556528568268, 'recall': 0.2621985375881195, 'f1': 0.2535487413406372}"", ""{'precision': 0.19026708602905273, 'recall': 0.1819763332605362, 'f1': 0.18744036555290222}"", ""{'precision': -0.07508712261915207, 'recall': 0.037153083831071854, 'f1': -0.017948396503925323}"", ""{'precision': 0.2166709154844284, 'recall': 0.17746104300022125, 'f1': 0.19829514622688293}"", ""{'precision': 0.07609530538320541, 'recall': 0.12819607555866241, 'f1': 0.10347115993499756}"", ""{'precision': 0.23566016554832458, 'recall': 0.2002030313014984, 'f1': 0.2191401720046997}"", ""{'precision': 0.039474498480558395, 'recall': 0.03034212253987789, 'f1': 0.03647209703922272}"", ""{'precision': 0.17368051409721375, 'recall': 0.15962590277194977, 'f1': 0.16799703240394592}"", ""{'precision': -0.06723884493112564, 'recall': 0.22073249518871307, 'f1': 0.07412375509738922}"", ""{'precision': 0.13290952146053314, 'recall': 0.07355167716741562, 'f1': 0.1045115739107132}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1231552158867506, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1595867466221573, 0.2816988029230364, 0.0375123027908174, 0.0, 0.121658365925153, 0.0026883850904072, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1601171066931316, 0.0, 0.118127981268613, 0.023413470249148, 0.1743353397675923, 0.017465844953817, 0.0, 0.1669695384489661, 0.1627683104536919, 0.0, 0.0606433872310888, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.1666666666666665, 3.8181818181818183, 1.105263157894737, 4.357142857142857, 8.142857142857142, 8.285714285714286, 6.2, 3.6666666666666665, 1.903225806451613, 1.0285714285714285, 2.5789473684210527, 4.0, 2.8666666666666667, 2.15, 5.8, 4.333333333333333, 2.3, 6.714285714285714, 1.5357142857142858, 2.869565217391304, 1.24, 2.0714285714285716, 3.111111111111111, 1.5454545454545454, 1.037037037037037, 4.714285714285714, 1.2666666666666666, 2.4545454545454546, 2.25, 3.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.10684812068939209, 'recall': 0.03631405159831047, 'f1': 0.07283965498209}"", ""{'precision': 0.18081633746623993, 'recall': 0.21930274367332458, 'f1': 0.20128819346427917}"", ""{'precision': 0.17166095972061157, 'recall': 0.13189461827278137, 'f1': 0.15307734906673431}"", ""{'precision': 0.2035761922597885, 'recall': 0.36162516474723816, 'f1': 0.28257477283477783}"", ""{'precision': -0.007911596447229385, 'recall': 0.07360721379518509, 'f1': 0.03408719226717949}"", ""{'precision': -0.029209056869149208, 'recall': -0.0254511758685112, 'f1': -0.025661807507276535}"", ""{'precision': -0.28529930114746094, 'recall': -0.1471974402666092, 'f1': -0.21527764201164246}"", ""{'precision': 0.06908895075321198, 'recall': 0.19120818376541138, 'f1': 0.1308295577764511}"", ""{'precision': 0.24328982830047607, 'recall': 0.3773156702518463, 'f1': 0.3105713427066803}"", ""{'precision': 0.37962114810943604, 'recall': 0.23239125311374664, 'f1': 0.30609819293022156}"", ""{'precision': 0.14460481703281403, 'recall': 0.2137676626443863, 'f1': 0.18028776347637177}"", ""{'precision': 0.054828621447086334, 'recall': 0.1578940600156784, 'f1': 0.10728989541530609}"", ""{'precision': 0.3231819272041321, 'recall': 0.42914193868637085, 'f1': 0.3766500651836395}"", ""{'precision': 0.06238151714205742, 'recall': 0.07595311105251312, 'f1': 0.07067088782787323}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.040648944675922394, 'recall': 0.0014439028454944491, 'f1': 0.02255857363343239}"", ""{'precision': 0.33503711223602295, 'recall': 0.3662688434123993, 'f1': 0.3516627848148346}"", ""{'precision': -0.0808199793100357, 'recall': 0.04339419677853584, 'f1': -0.017838211730122566}"", ""{'precision': 0.17228850722312927, 'recall': 0.16112887859344482, 'f1': 0.16805635392665863}"", ""{'precision': 0.16065724194049835, 'recall': 0.2842628061771393, 'f1': 0.22298717498779297}"", ""{'precision': 0.19424818456172943, 'recall': 0.25405827164649963, 'f1': 0.22524210810661316}"", ""{'precision': 0.20658765733242035, 'recall': 0.1472964882850647, 'f1': 0.17810629308223724}"", ""{'precision': 0.02119770273566246, 'recall': 0.08223419636487961, 'f1': 0.0530717670917511}"", ""{'precision': 0.3092431426048279, 'recall': 0.23614603281021118, 'f1': 0.273618221282959}"", ""{'precision': 0.15373331308364868, 'recall': 0.1726284623146057, 'f1': 0.16452297568321228}"", ""{'precision': 0.1746618002653122, 'recall': 0.22373667359352112, 'f1': 0.20038409531116486}"", ""{'precision': 0.08880196511745453, 'recall': 0.07461851090192795, 'f1': 0.08319153636693954}"", ""{'precision': 0.1476742923259735, 'recall': 0.07884303480386734, 'f1': 0.11446332186460495}"", ""{'precision': -0.23309831321239471, 'recall': 0.09990908950567245, 'f1': -0.07053916156291962}"", ""{'precision': 0.03019283153116703, 'recall': 0.08091480284929276, 'f1': 0.05696043372154236}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.01413928988305, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.232914392851028, 0.288552621816469, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0777051775670442, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1016052632718472, 0.0, 0.1037397015701301, 0.0456987312059718, 0.0722312220036983, 0.1387480518647602, 0.0, 0.1161288667856411, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0851336600337967, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[5.666666666666667, 2.636363636363636, 2.789473684210526, 3.928571428571429, 6.714285714285714, 6.142857142857143, 7.0, 4.25, 1.4838709677419355, 1.0285714285714285, 2.789473684210526, 3.4, 3.0, 4.9, 5.8, 6.111111111111111, 2.5, 5.142857142857143, 1.5357142857142858, 2.652173913043478, 1.64, 1.1428571428571428, 6.888888888888889, 1.8484848484848484, 3.0, 5.714285714285714, 1.1, 2.909090909090909, 5.125, 2.6818181818181817]","[""{'precision': -0.09311841428279877, 'recall': -0.01294065173715353, 'f1': -0.051645345985889435}"", ""{'precision': 0.2109493762254715, 'recall': 0.20667512714862823, 'f1': 0.21009676158428192}"", ""{'precision': -0.02898159623146057, 'recall': 0.15586157143115997, 'f1': 0.0632597804069519}"", ""{'precision': 0.25616416335105896, 'recall': 0.3921296298503876, 'f1': 0.32437044382095337}"", ""{'precision': -0.03161277994513512, 'recall': 0.057851266115903854, 'f1': 0.014321071095764637}"", ""{'precision': -0.03530910238623619, 'recall': 0.05106435716152191, 'f1': 0.009115110151469707}"", ""{'precision': -0.35257774591445923, 'recall': -0.09080387651920319, 'f1': -0.22332797944545746}"", ""{'precision': 0.01716284081339836, 'recall': 0.16772548854351044, 'f1': 0.09279683977365494}"", ""{'precision': 0.3477271497249603, 'recall': 0.3651588559150696, 'f1': 0.35747477412223816}"", ""{'precision': 0.4063907563686371, 'recall': 0.23384788632392883, 'f1': 0.3198058307170868}"", ""{'precision': 0.09873276203870773, 'recall': 0.18228335678577423, 'f1': 0.14156284928321838}"", ""{'precision': 0.09469754993915558, 'recall': 0.19298988580703735, 'f1': 0.14476250112056732}"", ""{'precision': 0.32154300808906555, 'recall': 0.36767488718032837, 'f1': 0.345574289560318}"", ""{'precision': -0.08242210745811462, 'recall': 0.07026062160730362, 'f1': -0.005622691474854946}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.0636489987373352, 'recall': 0.29298919439315796, 'f1': 0.17709165811538696}"", ""{'precision': 0.32472991943359375, 'recall': 0.4210628569126129, 'f1': 0.37348079681396484}"", ""{'precision': 0.011358527466654778, 'recall': 0.052887097001075745, 'f1': 0.03360971808433533}"", ""{'precision': 0.17086820304393768, 'recall': 0.14884509146213531, 'f1': 0.16119760274887085}"", ""{'precision': 0.18676285445690155, 'recall': 0.2741827070713043, 'f1': 0.23135605454444885}"", ""{'precision': 0.01473683025687933, 'recall': 0.23198658227920532, 'f1': 0.1224624440073967}"", ""{'precision': 0.31424480676651, 'recall': 0.09978776425123215, 'f1': 0.2060675323009491}"", ""{'precision': -0.09696684777736664, 'recall': 0.08984457701444626, 'f1': -0.0036923084408044815}"", ""{'precision': 0.2577022612094879, 'recall': 0.20712047815322876, 'f1': 0.23353365063667297}"", ""{'precision': 0.04533824324607849, 'recall': 0.1415725201368332, 'f1': 0.09447082877159119}"", ""{'precision': 0.15169040858745575, 'recall': 0.21877674758434296, 'f1': 0.18633955717086792}"", ""{'precision': 0.09471594542264938, 'recall': 0.08893232047557831, 'f1': 0.09329762309789658}"", ""{'precision': 0.13611166179180145, 'recall': 0.09732230752706528, 'f1': 0.11807652562856674}"", ""{'precision': -0.1604962795972824, 'recall': 0.15840131044387817, 'f1': -0.00455790851265192}"", ""{'precision': 0.08433659374713898, 'recall': 0.07663544267416, 'f1': 0.08197701722383499}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1035056673507767, 0.0671608869518552, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2584050114622343, 0.3223659397724296, 0.138290599624506, 0.0, 0.1969509557508073, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0986639785766601, 0.0, 0.0018812325738725, 0.0822918270022972, 0.0246503920127183, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0802679530882732, 0.1523317510883013, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0576822277357025]","[3.9166666666666665, 3.636363636363636, 0.4736842105263157, 3.4285714285714284, 10.0, 4.285714285714286, 3.8, 2.5833333333333335, 1.3548387096774193, 0.8857142857142857, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7333333333333334, 2.4, 5.35, 11.0, 4.888888888888889, 2.9, 2.7142857142857144, 1.9642857142857144, 2.260869565217391, 2.0, 2.2857142857142856, 4.333333333333333, 2.060606060606061, 0.925925925925926, 5.0, 1.7666666666666666, 4.2727272727272725, 8.875, 1.5454545454545454]","[""{'precision': 0.018605075776576996, 'recall': 0.027676809579133987, 'f1': 0.024723809212446213}"", ""{'precision': 0.11408830434083939, 'recall': 0.12945179641246796, 'f1': 0.12318607419729233}"", ""{'precision': -0.044818583875894547, 'recall': 0.039317525923252106, 'f1': -0.0014776296447962523}"", ""{'precision': 0.28842395544052124, 'recall': 0.400706022977829, 'f1': 0.3450360596179962}"", ""{'precision': -0.05558670684695244, 'recall': 0.05271483585238457, 'f1': -0.00039977935375645757}"", ""{'precision': 0.16830281913280487, 'recall': 0.07726295292377472, 'f1': 0.12379739433526993}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.017596537247300148, 'recall': 0.0009918430587276816, 'f1': 0.010889396071434021}"", ""{'precision': 0.3915248215198517, 'recall': 0.3192733824253082, 'f1': 0.35619881749153137}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.22101496160030365, 'recall': 0.1334792971611023, 'f1': 0.17820799350738525}"", ""{'precision': 0.1150352880358696, 'recall': 0.19117280840873718, 'f1': 0.1541975736618042}"", ""{'precision': 0.40110504627227783, 'recall': 0.40135687589645386, 'f1': 0.4022037982940674}"", ""{'precision': -0.0658365860581398, 'recall': 0.0735541507601738, 'f1': 0.004498577211052179}"", ""{'precision': -0.07433929294347763, 'recall': -0.10522875189781189, 'f1': -0.08806341141462326}"", ""{'precision': 0.06748929619789124, 'recall': 0.10652444511651993, 'f1': 0.08841516077518463}"", ""{'precision': 0.3841123580932617, 'recall': 0.2892446517944336, 'f1': 0.3373279571533203}"", ""{'precision': 0.03829863667488098, 'recall': 0.039665237069129944, 'f1': 0.04054334759712219}"", ""{'precision': 0.0621151439845562, 'recall': 0.06140831857919693, 'f1': 0.06328627467155457}"", ""{'precision': 0.2234218567609787, 'recall': 0.2235700637102127, 'f1': 0.22475756704807281}"", ""{'precision': 0.09432080388069153, 'recall': 0.19741639494895935, 'f1': 0.14673668146133423}"", ""{'precision': 0.17018228769302368, 'recall': 0.17701993882656097, 'f1': 0.17494195699691772}"", ""{'precision': -0.05711100995540619, 'recall': 0.15987704694271088, 'f1': 0.05057244002819061}"", ""{'precision': 0.1795092225074768, 'recall': 0.22820739448070526, 'f1': 0.20503807067871094}"", ""{'precision': 0.17392954230308533, 'recall': 0.1660403460264206, 'f1': 0.17133016884326935}"", ""{'precision': 0.24478335678577423, 'recall': 0.23942787945270538, 'f1': 0.2433353066444397}"", ""{'precision': 0.051276274025440216, 'recall': 0.03819303587079048, 'f1': 0.04627799242734909}"", ""{'precision': 0.0014669972006231546, 'recall': 0.09220745414495468, 'f1': 0.04797528684139252}"", ""{'precision': -0.14923645555973053, 'recall': 0.13711276650428772, 'f1': -0.008572653867304325}"", ""{'precision': 0.06578033417463303, 'recall': 0.1044427752494812, 'f1': 0.08652433007955551}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use (with examples): ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Format your answer as follows: (Teaching Method) (Response) Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.280274337093472, 0.0595901505578131, 0.0634508564975691, 0.0, 0.1072481046120325, 0.2331032305449905, 0.1887971609447683, 0.4482468976384072, 0.218167631398606, 0.2372445311148961, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1737546155282429, 0.1121535111154828, 0.1455629308592705, 0.2691694521503486, 0.0387265856899321, 0.1543118895803178, 0.1429861229229596, 0.2223921435844164, 0.1244109327523227, 0.0, 0.1376201412853196, 0.0359484198870081, 0.0885679996609688, 0.1497610494494438]","[2.4166666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 1.7142857142857142, 1.8571428571428572, 2.142857142857143, 2.4, 1.5833333333333333, 0.8064516129032258, 0.3714285714285714, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 3.0, 1.8888888888888888, 1.7, 2.4285714285714284, 1.1071428571428572, 0.9130434782608696, 0.56, 1.4285714285714286, 0.7777777777777778, 0.8181818181818182, 1.2592592592592593, 1.8571428571428572, 0.5333333333333333, 2.090909090909091, 1.875, 0.9090909090909092]","[""{'precision': 0.13864237070083618, 'recall': 0.22377946972846985, 'f1': 0.18218955397605896}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.29420068860054016, 'recall': 0.45664507150650024, 'f1': 0.37520068883895874}"", ""{'precision': 0.13351726531982422, 'recall': 0.29529616236686707, 'f1': 0.21441839635372162}"", ""{'precision': 0.29231661558151245, 'recall': 0.2771975100040436, 'f1': 0.28590792417526245}"", ""{'precision': -0.16725677251815796, 'recall': -0.02978040836751461, 'f1': -0.09770578891038895}"", ""{'precision': 0.218782439827919, 'recall': 0.24108827114105225, 'f1': 0.2311628758907318}"", ""{'precision': 0.24765720963478088, 'recall': 0.2681216597557068, 'f1': 0.25907573103904724}"", ""{'precision': 0.17579273879528046, 'recall': 0.0702231302857399, 'f1': 0.12388003617525101}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.08622314035892487, 'recall': 0.32667577266693115, 'f1': 0.2049374133348465}"", ""{'precision': 0.25753599405288696, 'recall': 0.3161171078681946, 'f1': 0.2878223955631256}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.13379955291748047, 'recall': 0.09721406549215317, 'f1': 0.11687683314085007}"", ""{'precision': 0.015880854800343513, 'recall': 0.0830654427409172, 'f1': 0.05079316720366478}"", ""{'precision': 0.23008720576763153, 'recall': 0.4026769995689392, 'f1': 0.31608065962791443}"", ""{'precision': 0.296329528093338, 'recall': 0.46848103404045105, 'f1': 0.38202130794525146}"", ""{'precision': 0.12538881599903107, 'recall': 0.12354177236557007, 'f1': 0.12588776648044586}"", ""{'precision': 0.3607337772846222, 'recall': 0.31556951999664307, 'f1': 0.33912941813468933}"", ""{'precision': -0.07983797043561935, 'recall': 0.057360295206308365, 'f1': -0.010546828620135784}"", ""{'precision': 0.31597214937210083, 'recall': 0.2876557409763336, 'f1': 0.3029094934463501}"", ""{'precision': 0.09233592450618744, 'recall': 0.2008637934923172, 'f1': 0.14741015434265137}"", ""{'precision': 0.22945044934749603, 'recall': 0.2754858434200287, 'f1': 0.2535819411277771}"", ""{'precision': 0.1828542798757553, 'recall': 0.2094971388578415, 'f1': 0.19744791090488434}"", ""{'precision': 0.10266786813735962, 'recall': 0.19699440896511078, 'f1': 0.1507779061794281}"", ""{'precision': 0.10981395095586777, 'recall': 0.047144029289484024, 'f1': 0.07977928966283798}"", ""{'precision': 0.09698135405778885, 'recall': 0.290243923664093, 'f1': 0.1931089609861374}"", ""{'precision': 0.07298797369003296, 'recall': 0.2475324124097824, 'f1': 0.16013599932193756}"", ""{'precision': 0.09527769684791565, 'recall': 0.10083868354558945, 'f1': 0.09952209889888763}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.0602024057870188, 0.0369230996710913, 0.0334222354874107, 0.0, 0.0172822121316674, 0.2822177794147447, 0.1264396151914723, 0.4482468976384072, 0.2166361496557471, 0.2112315144141515, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1458772459155634, 0.0484547153022719, 0.0976198112765639, 0.1287198804729226, 0.0252047787261781, 0.0963881797449929, 0.0319340280246817, 0.2765885904901324, 0.0176132574100486, 0.0, 0.1542999093435335, 0.2538067443387491, 0.0, 0.1461071665346364]","[2.1666666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 2.7142857142857144, 1.7142857142857142, 2.142857142857143, 1.4, 1.3333333333333333, 0.3870967741935484, 0.6285714285714286, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 4.8, 1.5555555555555556, 2.7, 2.142857142857143, 0.6071428571428571, 1.608695652173913, 1.2, 1.7857142857142858, 1.1111111111111112, 0.4545454545454545, 1.4074074074074074, 3.2857142857142856, 0.5333333333333333, 1.3636363636363635, 5.125, 0.8181818181818182]","[""{'precision': 0.11144650727510452, 'recall': 0.16678740084171295, 'f1': 0.1403663456439972}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.16733106970787048, 'recall': 0.34498879313468933, 'f1': 0.2558545470237732}"", ""{'precision': 0.14777971804141998, 'recall': 0.12287995219230652, 'f1': 0.13670334219932556}"", ""{'precision': 0.14047302305698395, 'recall': 0.16943396627902985, 'f1': 0.15628546476364136}"", ""{'precision': -0.1741969883441925, 'recall': -0.2152625024318695, 'f1': -0.19287870824337006}"", ""{'precision': 0.10095961391925812, 'recall': -0.010690257884562016, 'f1': 0.04605867713689804}"", ""{'precision': 0.4403025507926941, 'recall': 0.15784242749214172, 'f1': 0.29640036821365356}"", ""{'precision': 0.1082160696387291, 'recall': -0.02357855811715126, 'f1': 0.043000295758247375}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.0672667920589447, 'recall': 0.34117069840431213, 'f1': 0.20187444984912872}"", ""{'precision': 0.21142058074474335, 'recall': 0.2578919529914856, 'f1': 0.23579636216163635}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.07662168145179749, 'recall': -0.05927005410194397, 'f1': 0.00935102254152298}"", ""{'precision': -0.02370366081595421, 'recall': -0.02631603181362152, 'f1': -0.02334471233189106}"", ""{'precision': 0.3802837133407593, 'recall': 0.37594321370124817, 'f1': 0.37912291288375854}"", ""{'precision': 0.22057241201400757, 'recall': 0.2892892360687256, 'f1': 0.25591564178466797}"", ""{'precision': 0.13475148379802704, 'recall': -0.040554143488407135, 'f1': 0.047102976590394974}"", ""{'precision': 0.2246946543455124, 'recall': 0.10567621141672134, 'f1': 0.16584555804729462}"", ""{'precision': -0.022776130586862564, 'recall': 0.083047054708004, 'f1': 0.031150298193097115}"", ""{'precision': 0.2631351351737976, 'recall': 0.2743387222290039, 'f1': 0.269919216632843}"", ""{'precision': -0.08870362490415573, 'recall': 0.10129321366548538, 'f1': 0.006090278271585703}"", ""{'precision': 0.42749470472335815, 'recall': 0.1397526115179062, 'f1': 0.28082096576690674}"", ""{'precision': 0.06014829874038696, 'recall': 0.12220893800258636, 'f1': 0.09246557205915451}"", ""{'precision': 0.2430046945810318, 'recall': 0.3270018994808197, 'f1': 0.2858295142650604}"", ""{'precision': 0.14836622774600983, 'recall': 0.00877873133867979, 'f1': 0.07909627258777618}"", ""{'precision': 0.2596312463283539, 'recall': 0.2833509147167206, 'f1': 0.2726484537124634}"", ""{'precision': -0.04212549328804016, 'recall': 0.2262428104877472, 'f1': 0.0899641290307045}"", ""{'precision': 0.13963252305984497, 'recall': 0.06494591385126114, 'f1': 0.10346974432468414}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  Directly answer the student's question.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.1387281377207149, 0.0326287712524776, 0.0931273669314074, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3685939814893283, 0.3223659397724296, 0.2835382546816534, 0.0353186986044697, 0.2098288242723427, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1303345371663271, 0.1411195762450153, 0.2307743706703186, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1447803716874165, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0144460941817118, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.0833333333333335, 1.6363636363636365, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7857142857142856, 5.142857142857143, 8.285714285714286, 3.8, 3.6666666666666665, 0.7741935483870968, 0.8857142857142857, 1.2105263157894737, 2.0, 2.3333333333333335, 2.75, 6.8, 6.888888888888889, 3.7, 5.571428571428571, 0.9642857142857144, 1.6521739130434785, 0.92, 3.2857142857142856, 5.111111111111111, 1.4848484848484849, 2.2222222222222223, 4.571428571428571, 1.3666666666666667, 2.727272727272727, 8.75, 2.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.11432495713233948, 'recall': 0.03324726223945618, 'f1': 0.07496145367622375}"", ""{'precision': 0.34705960750579834, 'recall': 0.16323672235012054, 'f1': 0.2547290027141571}"", ""{'precision': -0.04055697098374367, 'recall': 0.13544459640979767, 'f1': 0.047443777322769165}"", ""{'precision': 0.2874433696269989, 'recall': 0.3909418284893036, 'f1': 0.33976122736930847}"", ""{'precision': 0.013704590499401093, 'recall': 0.1261105239391327, 'f1': 0.07079096138477325}"", ""{'precision': 0.0022958312183618546, 'recall': 0.0070695350877940655, 'f1': 0.006298996973782778}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.04759303852915764, 'recall': 0.14297078549861908, 'f1': 0.09630267322063446}"", ""{'precision': 0.5061132907867432, 'recall': 0.3179398477077484, 'f1': 0.4113249182701111}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.3297567069530487, 'recall': 0.20683324337005615, 'f1': 0.268756240606308}"", ""{'precision': 0.0749378353357315, 'recall': 0.11573436856269836, 'f1': 0.09672435373067856}"", ""{'precision': 0.4073179364204407, 'recall': 0.39869120717048645, 'f1': 0.4039713740348816}"", ""{'precision': -0.009095241315662861, 'recall': 0.020507877692580223, 'f1': 0.007277961820363998}"", ""{'precision': -0.06473217904567719, 'recall': -0.034142181277275085, 'f1': -0.047779280692338943}"", ""{'precision': -0.04261331260204315, 'recall': 0.1446707844734192, 'f1': 0.050818946212530136}"", ""{'precision': 0.3305618166923523, 'recall': 0.26773256063461304, 'f1': 0.30009621381759644}"", ""{'precision': -0.031261153519153595, 'recall': 0.018836529925465584, 'f1': -0.004703410901129246}"", ""{'precision': 0.15156836807727814, 'recall': 0.07251915335655212, 'f1': 0.11317533999681473}"", ""{'precision': 0.22911085188388824, 'recall': 0.17426548898220062, 'f1': 0.20283786952495575}"", ""{'precision': 0.24250556528568268, 'recall': 0.2621985375881195, 'f1': 0.2535487413406372}"", ""{'precision': 0.19026708602905273, 'recall': 0.1819763332605362, 'f1': 0.18744036555290222}"", ""{'precision': -0.07508712261915207, 'recall': 0.037153083831071854, 'f1': -0.017948396503925323}"", ""{'precision': 0.2166709154844284, 'recall': 0.17746104300022125, 'f1': 0.19829514622688293}"", ""{'precision': 0.07609530538320541, 'recall': 0.12819607555866241, 'f1': 0.10347115993499756}"", ""{'precision': 0.23566016554832458, 'recall': 0.2002030313014984, 'f1': 0.2191401720046997}"", ""{'precision': 0.039474498480558395, 'recall': 0.03034212253987789, 'f1': 0.03647209703922272}"", ""{'precision': 0.17368051409721375, 'recall': 0.15962590277194977, 'f1': 0.16799703240394592}"", ""{'precision': -0.06723884493112564, 'recall': 0.22073249518871307, 'f1': 0.07412375509738922}"", ""{'precision': 0.13290952146053314, 'recall': 0.07355167716741562, 'f1': 0.1045115739107132}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1231552158867506, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1595867466221573, 0.2816988029230364, 0.0375123027908174, 0.0, 0.121658365925153, 0.0026883850904072, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1601171066931316, 0.0, 0.118127981268613, 0.023413470249148, 0.1743353397675923, 0.017465844953817, 0.0, 0.1669695384489661, 0.1627683104536919, 0.0, 0.0606433872310888, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.1666666666666665, 3.8181818181818183, 1.105263157894737, 4.357142857142857, 8.142857142857142, 8.285714285714286, 6.2, 3.6666666666666665, 1.903225806451613, 1.0285714285714285, 2.5789473684210527, 4.0, 2.8666666666666667, 2.15, 5.8, 4.333333333333333, 2.3, 6.714285714285714, 1.5357142857142858, 2.869565217391304, 1.24, 2.0714285714285716, 3.111111111111111, 1.5454545454545454, 1.037037037037037, 4.714285714285714, 1.2666666666666666, 2.4545454545454546, 2.25, 3.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.10684812068939209, 'recall': 0.03631405159831047, 'f1': 0.07283965498209}"", ""{'precision': 0.18081633746623993, 'recall': 0.21930274367332458, 'f1': 0.20128819346427917}"", ""{'precision': 0.17166095972061157, 'recall': 0.13189461827278137, 'f1': 0.15307734906673431}"", ""{'precision': 0.2035761922597885, 'recall': 0.36162516474723816, 'f1': 0.28257477283477783}"", ""{'precision': -0.007911596447229385, 'recall': 0.07360721379518509, 'f1': 0.03408719226717949}"", ""{'precision': -0.029209056869149208, 'recall': -0.0254511758685112, 'f1': -0.025661807507276535}"", ""{'precision': -0.28529930114746094, 'recall': -0.1471974402666092, 'f1': -0.21527764201164246}"", ""{'precision': 0.06908895075321198, 'recall': 0.19120818376541138, 'f1': 0.1308295577764511}"", ""{'precision': 0.24328982830047607, 'recall': 0.3773156702518463, 'f1': 0.3105713427066803}"", ""{'precision': 0.37962114810943604, 'recall': 0.23239125311374664, 'f1': 0.30609819293022156}"", ""{'precision': 0.14460481703281403, 'recall': 0.2137676626443863, 'f1': 0.18028776347637177}"", ""{'precision': 0.054828621447086334, 'recall': 0.1578940600156784, 'f1': 0.10728989541530609}"", ""{'precision': 0.3231819272041321, 'recall': 0.42914193868637085, 'f1': 0.3766500651836395}"", ""{'precision': 0.06238151714205742, 'recall': 0.07595311105251312, 'f1': 0.07067088782787323}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.040648944675922394, 'recall': 0.0014439028454944491, 'f1': 0.02255857363343239}"", ""{'precision': 0.33503711223602295, 'recall': 0.3662688434123993, 'f1': 0.3516627848148346}"", ""{'precision': -0.0808199793100357, 'recall': 0.04339419677853584, 'f1': -0.017838211730122566}"", ""{'precision': 0.17228850722312927, 'recall': 0.16112887859344482, 'f1': 0.16805635392665863}"", ""{'precision': 0.16065724194049835, 'recall': 0.2842628061771393, 'f1': 0.22298717498779297}"", ""{'precision': 0.19424818456172943, 'recall': 0.25405827164649963, 'f1': 0.22524210810661316}"", ""{'precision': 0.20658765733242035, 'recall': 0.1472964882850647, 'f1': 0.17810629308223724}"", ""{'precision': 0.02119770273566246, 'recall': 0.08223419636487961, 'f1': 0.0530717670917511}"", ""{'precision': 0.3092431426048279, 'recall': 0.23614603281021118, 'f1': 0.273618221282959}"", ""{'precision': 0.15373331308364868, 'recall': 0.1726284623146057, 'f1': 0.16452297568321228}"", ""{'precision': 0.1746618002653122, 'recall': 0.22373667359352112, 'f1': 0.20038409531116486}"", ""{'precision': 0.08880196511745453, 'recall': 0.07461851090192795, 'f1': 0.08319153636693954}"", ""{'precision': 0.1476742923259735, 'recall': 0.07884303480386734, 'f1': 0.11446332186460495}"", ""{'precision': -0.23309831321239471, 'recall': 0.09990908950567245, 'f1': -0.07053916156291962}"", ""{'precision': 0.03019283153116703, 'recall': 0.08091480284929276, 'f1': 0.05696043372154236}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.01413928988305, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.232914392851028, 0.288552621816469, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0777051775670442, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1016052632718472, 0.0, 0.1037397015701301, 0.0456987312059718, 0.0722312220036983, 0.1387480518647602, 0.0, 0.1161288667856411, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0851336600337967, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[5.666666666666667, 2.636363636363636, 2.789473684210526, 3.928571428571429, 6.714285714285714, 6.142857142857143, 7.0, 4.25, 1.4838709677419355, 1.0285714285714285, 2.789473684210526, 3.4, 3.0, 4.9, 5.8, 6.111111111111111, 2.5, 5.142857142857143, 1.5357142857142858, 2.652173913043478, 1.64, 1.1428571428571428, 6.888888888888889, 1.8484848484848484, 3.0, 5.714285714285714, 1.1, 2.909090909090909, 5.125, 2.6818181818181817]","[""{'precision': -0.09311841428279877, 'recall': -0.01294065173715353, 'f1': -0.051645345985889435}"", ""{'precision': 0.2109493762254715, 'recall': 0.20667512714862823, 'f1': 0.21009676158428192}"", ""{'precision': -0.02898159623146057, 'recall': 0.15586157143115997, 'f1': 0.0632597804069519}"", ""{'precision': 0.25616416335105896, 'recall': 0.3921296298503876, 'f1': 0.32437044382095337}"", ""{'precision': -0.03161277994513512, 'recall': 0.057851266115903854, 'f1': 0.014321071095764637}"", ""{'precision': -0.03530910238623619, 'recall': 0.05106435716152191, 'f1': 0.009115110151469707}"", ""{'precision': -0.35257774591445923, 'recall': -0.09080387651920319, 'f1': -0.22332797944545746}"", ""{'precision': 0.01716284081339836, 'recall': 0.16772548854351044, 'f1': 0.09279683977365494}"", ""{'precision': 0.3477271497249603, 'recall': 0.3651588559150696, 'f1': 0.35747477412223816}"", ""{'precision': 0.4063907563686371, 'recall': 0.23384788632392883, 'f1': 0.3198058307170868}"", ""{'precision': 0.09873276203870773, 'recall': 0.18228335678577423, 'f1': 0.14156284928321838}"", ""{'precision': 0.09469754993915558, 'recall': 0.19298988580703735, 'f1': 0.14476250112056732}"", ""{'precision': 0.32154300808906555, 'recall': 0.36767488718032837, 'f1': 0.345574289560318}"", ""{'precision': -0.08242210745811462, 'recall': 0.07026062160730362, 'f1': -0.005622691474854946}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.0636489987373352, 'recall': 0.29298919439315796, 'f1': 0.17709165811538696}"", ""{'precision': 0.32472991943359375, 'recall': 0.4210628569126129, 'f1': 0.37348079681396484}"", ""{'precision': 0.011358527466654778, 'recall': 0.052887097001075745, 'f1': 0.03360971808433533}"", ""{'precision': 0.17086820304393768, 'recall': 0.14884509146213531, 'f1': 0.16119760274887085}"", ""{'precision': 0.18676285445690155, 'recall': 0.2741827070713043, 'f1': 0.23135605454444885}"", ""{'precision': 0.01473683025687933, 'recall': 0.23198658227920532, 'f1': 0.1224624440073967}"", ""{'precision': 0.31424480676651, 'recall': 0.09978776425123215, 'f1': 0.2060675323009491}"", ""{'precision': -0.09696684777736664, 'recall': 0.08984457701444626, 'f1': -0.0036923084408044815}"", ""{'precision': 0.2577022612094879, 'recall': 0.20712047815322876, 'f1': 0.23353365063667297}"", ""{'precision': 0.04533824324607849, 'recall': 0.1415725201368332, 'f1': 0.09447082877159119}"", ""{'precision': 0.15169040858745575, 'recall': 0.21877674758434296, 'f1': 0.18633955717086792}"", ""{'precision': 0.09471594542264938, 'recall': 0.08893232047557831, 'f1': 0.09329762309789658}"", ""{'precision': 0.13611166179180145, 'recall': 0.09732230752706528, 'f1': 0.11807652562856674}"", ""{'precision': -0.1604962795972824, 'recall': 0.15840131044387817, 'f1': -0.00455790851265192}"", ""{'precision': 0.08433659374713898, 'recall': 0.07663544267416, 'f1': 0.08197701722383499}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1035056673507767, 0.0671608869518552, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2584050114622343, 0.3223659397724296, 0.138290599624506, 0.0, 0.1969509557508073, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0986639785766601, 0.0, 0.0018812325738725, 0.0822918270022972, 0.0246503920127183, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0802679530882732, 0.1523317510883013, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0576822277357025]","[3.9166666666666665, 3.636363636363636, 0.4736842105263157, 3.4285714285714284, 10.0, 4.285714285714286, 3.8, 2.5833333333333335, 1.3548387096774193, 0.8857142857142857, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7333333333333334, 2.4, 5.35, 11.0, 4.888888888888889, 2.9, 2.7142857142857144, 1.9642857142857144, 2.260869565217391, 2.0, 2.2857142857142856, 4.333333333333333, 2.060606060606061, 0.925925925925926, 5.0, 1.7666666666666666, 4.2727272727272725, 8.875, 1.5454545454545454]","[""{'precision': 0.018605075776576996, 'recall': 0.027676809579133987, 'f1': 0.024723809212446213}"", ""{'precision': 0.11408830434083939, 'recall': 0.12945179641246796, 'f1': 0.12318607419729233}"", ""{'precision': -0.044818583875894547, 'recall': 0.039317525923252106, 'f1': -0.0014776296447962523}"", ""{'precision': 0.28842395544052124, 'recall': 0.400706022977829, 'f1': 0.3450360596179962}"", ""{'precision': -0.05558670684695244, 'recall': 0.05271483585238457, 'f1': -0.00039977935375645757}"", ""{'precision': 0.16830281913280487, 'recall': 0.07726295292377472, 'f1': 0.12379739433526993}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.017596537247300148, 'recall': 0.0009918430587276816, 'f1': 0.010889396071434021}"", ""{'precision': 0.3915248215198517, 'recall': 0.3192733824253082, 'f1': 0.35619881749153137}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.22101496160030365, 'recall': 0.1334792971611023, 'f1': 0.17820799350738525}"", ""{'precision': 0.1150352880358696, 'recall': 0.19117280840873718, 'f1': 0.1541975736618042}"", ""{'precision': 0.40110504627227783, 'recall': 0.40135687589645386, 'f1': 0.4022037982940674}"", ""{'precision': -0.0658365860581398, 'recall': 0.0735541507601738, 'f1': 0.004498577211052179}"", ""{'precision': -0.07433929294347763, 'recall': -0.10522875189781189, 'f1': -0.08806341141462326}"", ""{'precision': 0.06748929619789124, 'recall': 0.10652444511651993, 'f1': 0.08841516077518463}"", ""{'precision': 0.3841123580932617, 'recall': 0.2892446517944336, 'f1': 0.3373279571533203}"", ""{'precision': 0.03829863667488098, 'recall': 0.039665237069129944, 'f1': 0.04054334759712219}"", ""{'precision': 0.0621151439845562, 'recall': 0.06140831857919693, 'f1': 0.06328627467155457}"", ""{'precision': 0.2234218567609787, 'recall': 0.2235700637102127, 'f1': 0.22475756704807281}"", ""{'precision': 0.09432080388069153, 'recall': 0.19741639494895935, 'f1': 0.14673668146133423}"", ""{'precision': 0.17018228769302368, 'recall': 0.17701993882656097, 'f1': 0.17494195699691772}"", ""{'precision': -0.05711100995540619, 'recall': 0.15987704694271088, 'f1': 0.05057244002819061}"", ""{'precision': 0.1795092225074768, 'recall': 0.22820739448070526, 'f1': 0.20503807067871094}"", ""{'precision': 0.17392954230308533, 'recall': 0.1660403460264206, 'f1': 0.17133016884326935}"", ""{'precision': 0.24478335678577423, 'recall': 0.23942787945270538, 'f1': 0.2433353066444397}"", ""{'precision': 0.051276274025440216, 'recall': 0.03819303587079048, 'f1': 0.04627799242734909}"", ""{'precision': 0.0014669972006231546, 'recall': 0.09220745414495468, 'f1': 0.04797528684139252}"", ""{'precision': -0.14923645555973053, 'recall': 0.13711276650428772, 'f1': -0.008572653867304325}"", ""{'precision': 0.06578033417463303, 'recall': 0.1044427752494812, 'f1': 0.08652433007955551}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use (with examples): ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Format your answer as follows: (Teaching Method) (Response) Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.280274337093472, 0.0595901505578131, 0.0634508564975691, 0.0, 0.1072481046120325, 0.2331032305449905, 0.1887971609447683, 0.4482468976384072, 0.218167631398606, 0.2372445311148961, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1737546155282429, 0.1121535111154828, 0.1455629308592705, 0.2691694521503486, 0.0387265856899321, 0.1543118895803178, 0.1429861229229596, 0.2223921435844164, 0.1244109327523227, 0.0, 0.1376201412853196, 0.0359484198870081, 0.0885679996609688, 0.1497610494494438]","[2.4166666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 1.7142857142857142, 1.8571428571428572, 2.142857142857143, 2.4, 1.5833333333333333, 0.8064516129032258, 0.3714285714285714, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 3.0, 1.8888888888888888, 1.7, 2.4285714285714284, 1.1071428571428572, 0.9130434782608696, 0.56, 1.4285714285714286, 0.7777777777777778, 0.8181818181818182, 1.2592592592592593, 1.8571428571428572, 0.5333333333333333, 2.090909090909091, 1.875, 0.9090909090909092]","[""{'precision': 0.13864237070083618, 'recall': 0.22377946972846985, 'f1': 0.18218955397605896}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.29420068860054016, 'recall': 0.45664507150650024, 'f1': 0.37520068883895874}"", ""{'precision': 0.13351726531982422, 'recall': 0.29529616236686707, 'f1': 0.21441839635372162}"", ""{'precision': 0.29231661558151245, 'recall': 0.2771975100040436, 'f1': 0.28590792417526245}"", ""{'precision': -0.16725677251815796, 'recall': -0.02978040836751461, 'f1': -0.09770578891038895}"", ""{'precision': 0.218782439827919, 'recall': 0.24108827114105225, 'f1': 0.2311628758907318}"", ""{'precision': 0.24765720963478088, 'recall': 0.2681216597557068, 'f1': 0.25907573103904724}"", ""{'precision': 0.17579273879528046, 'recall': 0.0702231302857399, 'f1': 0.12388003617525101}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.08622314035892487, 'recall': 0.32667577266693115, 'f1': 0.2049374133348465}"", ""{'precision': 0.25753599405288696, 'recall': 0.3161171078681946, 'f1': 0.2878223955631256}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.13379955291748047, 'recall': 0.09721406549215317, 'f1': 0.11687683314085007}"", ""{'precision': 0.015880854800343513, 'recall': 0.0830654427409172, 'f1': 0.05079316720366478}"", ""{'precision': 0.23008720576763153, 'recall': 0.4026769995689392, 'f1': 0.31608065962791443}"", ""{'precision': 0.296329528093338, 'recall': 0.46848103404045105, 'f1': 0.38202130794525146}"", ""{'precision': 0.12538881599903107, 'recall': 0.12354177236557007, 'f1': 0.12588776648044586}"", ""{'precision': 0.3607337772846222, 'recall': 0.31556951999664307, 'f1': 0.33912941813468933}"", ""{'precision': -0.07983797043561935, 'recall': 0.057360295206308365, 'f1': -0.010546828620135784}"", ""{'precision': 0.31597214937210083, 'recall': 0.2876557409763336, 'f1': 0.3029094934463501}"", ""{'precision': 0.09233592450618744, 'recall': 0.2008637934923172, 'f1': 0.14741015434265137}"", ""{'precision': 0.22945044934749603, 'recall': 0.2754858434200287, 'f1': 0.2535819411277771}"", ""{'precision': 0.1828542798757553, 'recall': 0.2094971388578415, 'f1': 0.19744791090488434}"", ""{'precision': 0.10266786813735962, 'recall': 0.19699440896511078, 'f1': 0.1507779061794281}"", ""{'precision': 0.10981395095586777, 'recall': 0.047144029289484024, 'f1': 0.07977928966283798}"", ""{'precision': 0.09698135405778885, 'recall': 0.290243923664093, 'f1': 0.1931089609861374}"", ""{'precision': 0.07298797369003296, 'recall': 0.2475324124097824, 'f1': 0.16013599932193756}"", ""{'precision': 0.09527769684791565, 'recall': 0.10083868354558945, 'f1': 0.09952209889888763}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.0602024057870188, 0.0369230996710913, 0.0334222354874107, 0.0, 0.0172822121316674, 0.2822177794147447, 0.1264396151914723, 0.4482468976384072, 0.2166361496557471, 0.2112315144141515, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1458772459155634, 0.0484547153022719, 0.0976198112765639, 0.1287198804729226, 0.0252047787261781, 0.0963881797449929, 0.0319340280246817, 0.2765885904901324, 0.0176132574100486, 0.0, 0.1542999093435335, 0.2538067443387491, 0.0, 0.1461071665346364]","[2.1666666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 2.7142857142857144, 1.7142857142857142, 2.142857142857143, 1.4, 1.3333333333333333, 0.3870967741935484, 0.6285714285714286, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 4.8, 1.5555555555555556, 2.7, 2.142857142857143, 0.6071428571428571, 1.608695652173913, 1.2, 1.7857142857142858, 1.1111111111111112, 0.4545454545454545, 1.4074074074074074, 3.2857142857142856, 0.5333333333333333, 1.3636363636363635, 5.125, 0.8181818181818182]","[""{'precision': 0.11144650727510452, 'recall': 0.16678740084171295, 'f1': 0.1403663456439972}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.16733106970787048, 'recall': 0.34498879313468933, 'f1': 0.2558545470237732}"", ""{'precision': 0.14777971804141998, 'recall': 0.12287995219230652, 'f1': 0.13670334219932556}"", ""{'precision': 0.14047302305698395, 'recall': 0.16943396627902985, 'f1': 0.15628546476364136}"", ""{'precision': -0.1741969883441925, 'recall': -0.2152625024318695, 'f1': -0.19287870824337006}"", ""{'precision': 0.10095961391925812, 'recall': -0.010690257884562016, 'f1': 0.04605867713689804}"", ""{'precision': 0.4403025507926941, 'recall': 0.15784242749214172, 'f1': 0.29640036821365356}"", ""{'precision': 0.1082160696387291, 'recall': -0.02357855811715126, 'f1': 0.043000295758247375}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.0672667920589447, 'recall': 0.34117069840431213, 'f1': 0.20187444984912872}"", ""{'precision': 0.21142058074474335, 'recall': 0.2578919529914856, 'f1': 0.23579636216163635}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.07662168145179749, 'recall': -0.05927005410194397, 'f1': 0.00935102254152298}"", ""{'precision': -0.02370366081595421, 'recall': -0.02631603181362152, 'f1': -0.02334471233189106}"", ""{'precision': 0.3802837133407593, 'recall': 0.37594321370124817, 'f1': 0.37912291288375854}"", ""{'precision': 0.22057241201400757, 'recall': 0.2892892360687256, 'f1': 0.25591564178466797}"", ""{'precision': 0.13475148379802704, 'recall': -0.040554143488407135, 'f1': 0.047102976590394974}"", ""{'precision': 0.2246946543455124, 'recall': 0.10567621141672134, 'f1': 0.16584555804729462}"", ""{'precision': -0.022776130586862564, 'recall': 0.083047054708004, 'f1': 0.031150298193097115}"", ""{'precision': 0.2631351351737976, 'recall': 0.2743387222290039, 'f1': 0.269919216632843}"", ""{'precision': -0.08870362490415573, 'recall': 0.10129321366548538, 'f1': 0.006090278271585703}"", ""{'precision': 0.42749470472335815, 'recall': 0.1397526115179062, 'f1': 0.28082096576690674}"", ""{'precision': 0.06014829874038696, 'recall': 0.12220893800258636, 'f1': 0.09246557205915451}"", ""{'precision': 0.2430046945810318, 'recall': 0.3270018994808197, 'f1': 0.2858295142650604}"", ""{'precision': 0.14836622774600983, 'recall': 0.00877873133867979, 'f1': 0.07909627258777618}"", ""{'precision': 0.2596312463283539, 'recall': 0.2833509147167206, 'f1': 0.2726484537124634}"", ""{'precision': -0.04212549328804016, 'recall': 0.2262428104877472, 'f1': 0.0899641290307045}"", ""{'precision': 0.13963252305984497, 'recall': 0.06494591385126114, 'f1': 0.10346974432468414}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  Directly answer the student's question.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.1387281377207149, 0.0326287712524776, 0.0931273669314074, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3685939814893283, 0.3223659397724296, 0.2835382546816534, 0.0353186986044697, 0.2098288242723427, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1303345371663271, 0.1411195762450153, 0.2307743706703186, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1447803716874165, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0144460941817118, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.0833333333333335, 1.6363636363636365, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7857142857142856, 5.142857142857143, 8.285714285714286, 3.8, 3.6666666666666665, 0.7741935483870968, 0.8857142857142857, 1.2105263157894737, 2.0, 2.3333333333333335, 2.75, 6.8, 6.888888888888889, 3.7, 5.571428571428571, 0.9642857142857144, 1.6521739130434785, 0.92, 3.2857142857142856, 5.111111111111111, 1.4848484848484849, 2.2222222222222223, 4.571428571428571, 1.3666666666666667, 2.727272727272727, 8.75, 2.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.11432495713233948, 'recall': 0.03324726223945618, 'f1': 0.07496145367622375}"", ""{'precision': 0.34705960750579834, 'recall': 0.16323672235012054, 'f1': 0.2547290027141571}"", ""{'precision': -0.04055697098374367, 'recall': 0.13544459640979767, 'f1': 0.047443777322769165}"", ""{'precision': 0.2874433696269989, 'recall': 0.3909418284893036, 'f1': 0.33976122736930847}"", ""{'precision': 0.013704590499401093, 'recall': 0.1261105239391327, 'f1': 0.07079096138477325}"", ""{'precision': 0.0022958312183618546, 'recall': 0.0070695350877940655, 'f1': 0.006298996973782778}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.04759303852915764, 'recall': 0.14297078549861908, 'f1': 0.09630267322063446}"", ""{'precision': 0.5061132907867432, 'recall': 0.3179398477077484, 'f1': 0.4113249182701111}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.3297567069530487, 'recall': 0.20683324337005615, 'f1': 0.268756240606308}"", ""{'precision': 0.0749378353357315, 'recall': 0.11573436856269836, 'f1': 0.09672435373067856}"", ""{'precision': 0.4073179364204407, 'recall': 0.39869120717048645, 'f1': 0.4039713740348816}"", ""{'precision': -0.009095241315662861, 'recall': 0.020507877692580223, 'f1': 0.007277961820363998}"", ""{'precision': -0.06473217904567719, 'recall': -0.034142181277275085, 'f1': -0.047779280692338943}"", ""{'precision': -0.04261331260204315, 'recall': 0.1446707844734192, 'f1': 0.050818946212530136}"", ""{'precision': 0.3305618166923523, 'recall': 0.26773256063461304, 'f1': 0.30009621381759644}"", ""{'precision': -0.031261153519153595, 'recall': 0.018836529925465584, 'f1': -0.004703410901129246}"", ""{'precision': 0.15156836807727814, 'recall': 0.07251915335655212, 'f1': 0.11317533999681473}"", ""{'precision': 0.22911085188388824, 'recall': 0.17426548898220062, 'f1': 0.20283786952495575}"", ""{'precision': 0.24250556528568268, 'recall': 0.2621985375881195, 'f1': 0.2535487413406372}"", ""{'precision': 0.19026708602905273, 'recall': 0.1819763332605362, 'f1': 0.18744036555290222}"", ""{'precision': -0.07508712261915207, 'recall': 0.037153083831071854, 'f1': -0.017948396503925323}"", ""{'precision': 0.2166709154844284, 'recall': 0.17746104300022125, 'f1': 0.19829514622688293}"", ""{'precision': 0.07609530538320541, 'recall': 0.12819607555866241, 'f1': 0.10347115993499756}"", ""{'precision': 0.23566016554832458, 'recall': 0.2002030313014984, 'f1': 0.2191401720046997}"", ""{'precision': 0.039474498480558395, 'recall': 0.03034212253987789, 'f1': 0.03647209703922272}"", ""{'precision': 0.17368051409721375, 'recall': 0.15962590277194977, 'f1': 0.16799703240394592}"", ""{'precision': -0.06723884493112564, 'recall': 0.22073249518871307, 'f1': 0.07412375509738922}"", ""{'precision': 0.13290952146053314, 'recall': 0.07355167716741562, 'f1': 0.1045115739107132}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1231552158867506, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1595867466221573, 0.2816988029230364, 0.0375123027908174, 0.0, 0.121658365925153, 0.0026883850904072, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1601171066931316, 0.0, 0.118127981268613, 0.023413470249148, 0.1743353397675923, 0.017465844953817, 0.0, 0.1669695384489661, 0.1627683104536919, 0.0, 0.0606433872310888, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.1666666666666665, 3.8181818181818183, 1.105263157894737, 4.357142857142857, 8.142857142857142, 8.285714285714286, 6.2, 3.6666666666666665, 1.903225806451613, 1.0285714285714285, 2.5789473684210527, 4.0, 2.8666666666666667, 2.15, 5.8, 4.333333333333333, 2.3, 6.714285714285714, 1.5357142857142858, 2.869565217391304, 1.24, 2.0714285714285716, 3.111111111111111, 1.5454545454545454, 1.037037037037037, 4.714285714285714, 1.2666666666666666, 2.4545454545454546, 2.25, 3.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.10684812068939209, 'recall': 0.03631405159831047, 'f1': 0.07283965498209}"", ""{'precision': 0.18081633746623993, 'recall': 0.21930274367332458, 'f1': 0.20128819346427917}"", ""{'precision': 0.17166095972061157, 'recall': 0.13189461827278137, 'f1': 0.15307734906673431}"", ""{'precision': 0.2035761922597885, 'recall': 0.36162516474723816, 'f1': 0.28257477283477783}"", ""{'precision': -0.007911596447229385, 'recall': 0.07360721379518509, 'f1': 0.03408719226717949}"", ""{'precision': -0.029209056869149208, 'recall': -0.0254511758685112, 'f1': -0.025661807507276535}"", ""{'precision': -0.28529930114746094, 'recall': -0.1471974402666092, 'f1': -0.21527764201164246}"", ""{'precision': 0.06908895075321198, 'recall': 0.19120818376541138, 'f1': 0.1308295577764511}"", ""{'precision': 0.24328982830047607, 'recall': 0.3773156702518463, 'f1': 0.3105713427066803}"", ""{'precision': 0.37962114810943604, 'recall': 0.23239125311374664, 'f1': 0.30609819293022156}"", ""{'precision': 0.14460481703281403, 'recall': 0.2137676626443863, 'f1': 0.18028776347637177}"", ""{'precision': 0.054828621447086334, 'recall': 0.1578940600156784, 'f1': 0.10728989541530609}"", ""{'precision': 0.3231819272041321, 'recall': 0.42914193868637085, 'f1': 0.3766500651836395}"", ""{'precision': 0.06238151714205742, 'recall': 0.07595311105251312, 'f1': 0.07067088782787323}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.040648944675922394, 'recall': 0.0014439028454944491, 'f1': 0.02255857363343239}"", ""{'precision': 0.33503711223602295, 'recall': 0.3662688434123993, 'f1': 0.3516627848148346}"", ""{'precision': -0.0808199793100357, 'recall': 0.04339419677853584, 'f1': -0.017838211730122566}"", ""{'precision': 0.17228850722312927, 'recall': 0.16112887859344482, 'f1': 0.16805635392665863}"", ""{'precision': 0.16065724194049835, 'recall': 0.2842628061771393, 'f1': 0.22298717498779297}"", ""{'precision': 0.19424818456172943, 'recall': 0.25405827164649963, 'f1': 0.22524210810661316}"", ""{'precision': 0.20658765733242035, 'recall': 0.1472964882850647, 'f1': 0.17810629308223724}"", ""{'precision': 0.02119770273566246, 'recall': 0.08223419636487961, 'f1': 0.0530717670917511}"", ""{'precision': 0.3092431426048279, 'recall': 0.23614603281021118, 'f1': 0.273618221282959}"", ""{'precision': 0.15373331308364868, 'recall': 0.1726284623146057, 'f1': 0.16452297568321228}"", ""{'precision': 0.1746618002653122, 'recall': 0.22373667359352112, 'f1': 0.20038409531116486}"", ""{'precision': 0.08880196511745453, 'recall': 0.07461851090192795, 'f1': 0.08319153636693954}"", ""{'precision': 0.1476742923259735, 'recall': 0.07884303480386734, 'f1': 0.11446332186460495}"", ""{'precision': -0.23309831321239471, 'recall': 0.09990908950567245, 'f1': -0.07053916156291962}"", ""{'precision': 0.03019283153116703, 'recall': 0.08091480284929276, 'f1': 0.05696043372154236}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.01413928988305, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.232914392851028, 0.288552621816469, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0777051775670442, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1016052632718472, 0.0, 0.1037397015701301, 0.0456987312059718, 0.0722312220036983, 0.1387480518647602, 0.0, 0.1161288667856411, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0851336600337967, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[5.666666666666667, 2.636363636363636, 2.789473684210526, 3.928571428571429, 6.714285714285714, 6.142857142857143, 7.0, 4.25, 1.4838709677419355, 1.0285714285714285, 2.789473684210526, 3.4, 3.0, 4.9, 5.8, 6.111111111111111, 2.5, 5.142857142857143, 1.5357142857142858, 2.652173913043478, 1.64, 1.1428571428571428, 6.888888888888889, 1.8484848484848484, 3.0, 5.714285714285714, 1.1, 2.909090909090909, 5.125, 2.6818181818181817]","[""{'precision': -0.09311841428279877, 'recall': -0.01294065173715353, 'f1': -0.051645345985889435}"", ""{'precision': 0.2109493762254715, 'recall': 0.20667512714862823, 'f1': 0.21009676158428192}"", ""{'precision': -0.02898159623146057, 'recall': 0.15586157143115997, 'f1': 0.0632597804069519}"", ""{'precision': 0.25616416335105896, 'recall': 0.3921296298503876, 'f1': 0.32437044382095337}"", ""{'precision': -0.03161277994513512, 'recall': 0.057851266115903854, 'f1': 0.014321071095764637}"", ""{'precision': -0.03530910238623619, 'recall': 0.05106435716152191, 'f1': 0.009115110151469707}"", ""{'precision': -0.35257774591445923, 'recall': -0.09080387651920319, 'f1': -0.22332797944545746}"", ""{'precision': 0.01716284081339836, 'recall': 0.16772548854351044, 'f1': 0.09279683977365494}"", ""{'precision': 0.3477271497249603, 'recall': 0.3651588559150696, 'f1': 0.35747477412223816}"", ""{'precision': 0.4063907563686371, 'recall': 0.23384788632392883, 'f1': 0.3198058307170868}"", ""{'precision': 0.09873276203870773, 'recall': 0.18228335678577423, 'f1': 0.14156284928321838}"", ""{'precision': 0.09469754993915558, 'recall': 0.19298988580703735, 'f1': 0.14476250112056732}"", ""{'precision': 0.32154300808906555, 'recall': 0.36767488718032837, 'f1': 0.345574289560318}"", ""{'precision': -0.08242210745811462, 'recall': 0.07026062160730362, 'f1': -0.005622691474854946}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.0636489987373352, 'recall': 0.29298919439315796, 'f1': 0.17709165811538696}"", ""{'precision': 0.32472991943359375, 'recall': 0.4210628569126129, 'f1': 0.37348079681396484}"", ""{'precision': 0.011358527466654778, 'recall': 0.052887097001075745, 'f1': 0.03360971808433533}"", ""{'precision': 0.17086820304393768, 'recall': 0.14884509146213531, 'f1': 0.16119760274887085}"", ""{'precision': 0.18676285445690155, 'recall': 0.2741827070713043, 'f1': 0.23135605454444885}"", ""{'precision': 0.01473683025687933, 'recall': 0.23198658227920532, 'f1': 0.1224624440073967}"", ""{'precision': 0.31424480676651, 'recall': 0.09978776425123215, 'f1': 0.2060675323009491}"", ""{'precision': -0.09696684777736664, 'recall': 0.08984457701444626, 'f1': -0.0036923084408044815}"", ""{'precision': 0.2577022612094879, 'recall': 0.20712047815322876, 'f1': 0.23353365063667297}"", ""{'precision': 0.04533824324607849, 'recall': 0.1415725201368332, 'f1': 0.09447082877159119}"", ""{'precision': 0.15169040858745575, 'recall': 0.21877674758434296, 'f1': 0.18633955717086792}"", ""{'precision': 0.09471594542264938, 'recall': 0.08893232047557831, 'f1': 0.09329762309789658}"", ""{'precision': 0.13611166179180145, 'recall': 0.09732230752706528, 'f1': 0.11807652562856674}"", ""{'precision': -0.1604962795972824, 'recall': 0.15840131044387817, 'f1': -0.00455790851265192}"", ""{'precision': 0.08433659374713898, 'recall': 0.07663544267416, 'f1': 0.08197701722383499}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1035056673507767, 0.0671608869518552, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2584050114622343, 0.3223659397724296, 0.138290599624506, 0.0, 0.1969509557508073, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0986639785766601, 0.0, 0.0018812325738725, 0.0822918270022972, 0.0246503920127183, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0802679530882732, 0.1523317510883013, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0576822277357025]","[3.9166666666666665, 3.636363636363636, 0.4736842105263157, 3.4285714285714284, 10.0, 4.285714285714286, 3.8, 2.5833333333333335, 1.3548387096774193, 0.8857142857142857, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7333333333333334, 2.4, 5.35, 11.0, 4.888888888888889, 2.9, 2.7142857142857144, 1.9642857142857144, 2.260869565217391, 2.0, 2.2857142857142856, 4.333333333333333, 2.060606060606061, 0.925925925925926, 5.0, 1.7666666666666666, 4.2727272727272725, 8.875, 1.5454545454545454]","[""{'precision': 0.018605075776576996, 'recall': 0.027676809579133987, 'f1': 0.024723809212446213}"", ""{'precision': 0.11408830434083939, 'recall': 0.12945179641246796, 'f1': 0.12318607419729233}"", ""{'precision': -0.044818583875894547, 'recall': 0.039317525923252106, 'f1': -0.0014776296447962523}"", ""{'precision': 0.28842395544052124, 'recall': 0.400706022977829, 'f1': 0.3450360596179962}"", ""{'precision': -0.05558670684695244, 'recall': 0.05271483585238457, 'f1': -0.00039977935375645757}"", ""{'precision': 0.16830281913280487, 'recall': 0.07726295292377472, 'f1': 0.12379739433526993}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.017596537247300148, 'recall': 0.0009918430587276816, 'f1': 0.010889396071434021}"", ""{'precision': 0.3915248215198517, 'recall': 0.3192733824253082, 'f1': 0.35619881749153137}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.22101496160030365, 'recall': 0.1334792971611023, 'f1': 0.17820799350738525}"", ""{'precision': 0.1150352880358696, 'recall': 0.19117280840873718, 'f1': 0.1541975736618042}"", ""{'precision': 0.40110504627227783, 'recall': 0.40135687589645386, 'f1': 0.4022037982940674}"", ""{'precision': -0.0658365860581398, 'recall': 0.0735541507601738, 'f1': 0.004498577211052179}"", ""{'precision': -0.07433929294347763, 'recall': -0.10522875189781189, 'f1': -0.08806341141462326}"", ""{'precision': 0.06748929619789124, 'recall': 0.10652444511651993, 'f1': 0.08841516077518463}"", ""{'precision': 0.3841123580932617, 'recall': 0.2892446517944336, 'f1': 0.3373279571533203}"", ""{'precision': 0.03829863667488098, 'recall': 0.039665237069129944, 'f1': 0.04054334759712219}"", ""{'precision': 0.0621151439845562, 'recall': 0.06140831857919693, 'f1': 0.06328627467155457}"", ""{'precision': 0.2234218567609787, 'recall': 0.2235700637102127, 'f1': 0.22475756704807281}"", ""{'precision': 0.09432080388069153, 'recall': 0.19741639494895935, 'f1': 0.14673668146133423}"", ""{'precision': 0.17018228769302368, 'recall': 0.17701993882656097, 'f1': 0.17494195699691772}"", ""{'precision': -0.05711100995540619, 'recall': 0.15987704694271088, 'f1': 0.05057244002819061}"", ""{'precision': 0.1795092225074768, 'recall': 0.22820739448070526, 'f1': 0.20503807067871094}"", ""{'precision': 0.17392954230308533, 'recall': 0.1660403460264206, 'f1': 0.17133016884326935}"", ""{'precision': 0.24478335678577423, 'recall': 0.23942787945270538, 'f1': 0.2433353066444397}"", ""{'precision': 0.051276274025440216, 'recall': 0.03819303587079048, 'f1': 0.04627799242734909}"", ""{'precision': 0.0014669972006231546, 'recall': 0.09220745414495468, 'f1': 0.04797528684139252}"", ""{'precision': -0.14923645555973053, 'recall': 0.13711276650428772, 'f1': -0.008572653867304325}"", ""{'precision': 0.06578033417463303, 'recall': 0.1044427752494812, 'f1': 0.08652433007955551}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use (with examples): ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Format your answer as follows: (Teaching Method) (Response) Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.280274337093472, 0.0595901505578131, 0.0634508564975691, 0.0, 0.1072481046120325, 0.2331032305449905, 0.1887971609447683, 0.4482468976384072, 0.218167631398606, 0.2372445311148961, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1737546155282429, 0.1121535111154828, 0.1455629308592705, 0.2691694521503486, 0.0387265856899321, 0.1543118895803178, 0.1429861229229596, 0.2223921435844164, 0.1244109327523227, 0.0, 0.1376201412853196, 0.0359484198870081, 0.0885679996609688, 0.1497610494494438]","[2.4166666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 1.7142857142857142, 1.8571428571428572, 2.142857142857143, 2.4, 1.5833333333333333, 0.8064516129032258, 0.3714285714285714, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 3.0, 1.8888888888888888, 1.7, 2.4285714285714284, 1.1071428571428572, 0.9130434782608696, 0.56, 1.4285714285714286, 0.7777777777777778, 0.8181818181818182, 1.2592592592592593, 1.8571428571428572, 0.5333333333333333, 2.090909090909091, 1.875, 0.9090909090909092]","[""{'precision': 0.13864237070083618, 'recall': 0.22377946972846985, 'f1': 0.18218955397605896}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.29420068860054016, 'recall': 0.45664507150650024, 'f1': 0.37520068883895874}"", ""{'precision': 0.13351726531982422, 'recall': 0.29529616236686707, 'f1': 0.21441839635372162}"", ""{'precision': 0.29231661558151245, 'recall': 0.2771975100040436, 'f1': 0.28590792417526245}"", ""{'precision': -0.16725677251815796, 'recall': -0.02978040836751461, 'f1': -0.09770578891038895}"", ""{'precision': 0.218782439827919, 'recall': 0.24108827114105225, 'f1': 0.2311628758907318}"", ""{'precision': 0.24765720963478088, 'recall': 0.2681216597557068, 'f1': 0.25907573103904724}"", ""{'precision': 0.17579273879528046, 'recall': 0.0702231302857399, 'f1': 0.12388003617525101}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.08622314035892487, 'recall': 0.32667577266693115, 'f1': 0.2049374133348465}"", ""{'precision': 0.25753599405288696, 'recall': 0.3161171078681946, 'f1': 0.2878223955631256}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.13379955291748047, 'recall': 0.09721406549215317, 'f1': 0.11687683314085007}"", ""{'precision': 0.015880854800343513, 'recall': 0.0830654427409172, 'f1': 0.05079316720366478}"", ""{'precision': 0.23008720576763153, 'recall': 0.4026769995689392, 'f1': 0.31608065962791443}"", ""{'precision': 0.296329528093338, 'recall': 0.46848103404045105, 'f1': 0.38202130794525146}"", ""{'precision': 0.12538881599903107, 'recall': 0.12354177236557007, 'f1': 0.12588776648044586}"", ""{'precision': 0.3607337772846222, 'recall': 0.31556951999664307, 'f1': 0.33912941813468933}"", ""{'precision': -0.07983797043561935, 'recall': 0.057360295206308365, 'f1': -0.010546828620135784}"", ""{'precision': 0.31597214937210083, 'recall': 0.2876557409763336, 'f1': 0.3029094934463501}"", ""{'precision': 0.09233592450618744, 'recall': 0.2008637934923172, 'f1': 0.14741015434265137}"", ""{'precision': 0.22945044934749603, 'recall': 0.2754858434200287, 'f1': 0.2535819411277771}"", ""{'precision': 0.1828542798757553, 'recall': 0.2094971388578415, 'f1': 0.19744791090488434}"", ""{'precision': 0.10266786813735962, 'recall': 0.19699440896511078, 'f1': 0.1507779061794281}"", ""{'precision': 0.10981395095586777, 'recall': 0.047144029289484024, 'f1': 0.07977928966283798}"", ""{'precision': 0.09698135405778885, 'recall': 0.290243923664093, 'f1': 0.1931089609861374}"", ""{'precision': 0.07298797369003296, 'recall': 0.2475324124097824, 'f1': 0.16013599932193756}"", ""{'precision': 0.09527769684791565, 'recall': 0.10083868354558945, 'f1': 0.09952209889888763}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.0602024057870188, 0.0369230996710913, 0.0334222354874107, 0.0, 0.0172822121316674, 0.2822177794147447, 0.1264396151914723, 0.4482468976384072, 0.2166361496557471, 0.2112315144141515, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1458772459155634, 0.0484547153022719, 0.0976198112765639, 0.1287198804729226, 0.0252047787261781, 0.0963881797449929, 0.0319340280246817, 0.2765885904901324, 0.0176132574100486, 0.0, 0.1542999093435335, 0.2538067443387491, 0.0, 0.1461071665346364]","[2.1666666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 2.7142857142857144, 1.7142857142857142, 2.142857142857143, 1.4, 1.3333333333333333, 0.3870967741935484, 0.6285714285714286, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 4.8, 1.5555555555555556, 2.7, 2.142857142857143, 0.6071428571428571, 1.608695652173913, 1.2, 1.7857142857142858, 1.1111111111111112, 0.4545454545454545, 1.4074074074074074, 3.2857142857142856, 0.5333333333333333, 1.3636363636363635, 5.125, 0.8181818181818182]","[""{'precision': 0.11144650727510452, 'recall': 0.16678740084171295, 'f1': 0.1403663456439972}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.16733106970787048, 'recall': 0.34498879313468933, 'f1': 0.2558545470237732}"", ""{'precision': 0.14777971804141998, 'recall': 0.12287995219230652, 'f1': 0.13670334219932556}"", ""{'precision': 0.14047302305698395, 'recall': 0.16943396627902985, 'f1': 0.15628546476364136}"", ""{'precision': -0.1741969883441925, 'recall': -0.2152625024318695, 'f1': -0.19287870824337006}"", ""{'precision': 0.10095961391925812, 'recall': -0.010690257884562016, 'f1': 0.04605867713689804}"", ""{'precision': 0.4403025507926941, 'recall': 0.15784242749214172, 'f1': 0.29640036821365356}"", ""{'precision': 0.1082160696387291, 'recall': -0.02357855811715126, 'f1': 0.043000295758247375}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.0672667920589447, 'recall': 0.34117069840431213, 'f1': 0.20187444984912872}"", ""{'precision': 0.21142058074474335, 'recall': 0.2578919529914856, 'f1': 0.23579636216163635}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.07662168145179749, 'recall': -0.05927005410194397, 'f1': 0.00935102254152298}"", ""{'precision': -0.02370366081595421, 'recall': -0.02631603181362152, 'f1': -0.02334471233189106}"", ""{'precision': 0.3802837133407593, 'recall': 0.37594321370124817, 'f1': 0.37912291288375854}"", ""{'precision': 0.22057241201400757, 'recall': 0.2892892360687256, 'f1': 0.25591564178466797}"", ""{'precision': 0.13475148379802704, 'recall': -0.040554143488407135, 'f1': 0.047102976590394974}"", ""{'precision': 0.2246946543455124, 'recall': 0.10567621141672134, 'f1': 0.16584555804729462}"", ""{'precision': -0.022776130586862564, 'recall': 0.083047054708004, 'f1': 0.031150298193097115}"", ""{'precision': 0.2631351351737976, 'recall': 0.2743387222290039, 'f1': 0.269919216632843}"", ""{'precision': -0.08870362490415573, 'recall': 0.10129321366548538, 'f1': 0.006090278271585703}"", ""{'precision': 0.42749470472335815, 'recall': 0.1397526115179062, 'f1': 0.28082096576690674}"", ""{'precision': 0.06014829874038696, 'recall': 0.12220893800258636, 'f1': 0.09246557205915451}"", ""{'precision': 0.2430046945810318, 'recall': 0.3270018994808197, 'f1': 0.2858295142650604}"", ""{'precision': 0.14836622774600983, 'recall': 0.00877873133867979, 'f1': 0.07909627258777618}"", ""{'precision': 0.2596312463283539, 'recall': 0.2833509147167206, 'f1': 0.2726484537124634}"", ""{'precision': -0.04212549328804016, 'recall': 0.2262428104877472, 'f1': 0.0899641290307045}"", ""{'precision': 0.13963252305984497, 'recall': 0.06494591385126114, 'f1': 0.10346974432468414}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  Directly answer the student's question.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.1387281377207149, 0.0326287712524776, 0.0931273669314074, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3685939814893283, 0.3223659397724296, 0.2835382546816534, 0.0353186986044697, 0.2098288242723427, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1303345371663271, 0.1411195762450153, 0.2307743706703186, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1447803716874165, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0144460941817118, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.0833333333333335, 1.6363636363636365, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7857142857142856, 5.142857142857143, 8.285714285714286, 3.8, 3.6666666666666665, 0.7741935483870968, 0.8857142857142857, 1.2105263157894737, 2.0, 2.3333333333333335, 2.75, 6.8, 6.888888888888889, 3.7, 5.571428571428571, 0.9642857142857144, 1.6521739130434785, 0.92, 3.2857142857142856, 5.111111111111111, 1.4848484848484849, 2.2222222222222223, 4.571428571428571, 1.3666666666666667, 2.727272727272727, 8.75, 2.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.11432495713233948, 'recall': 0.03324726223945618, 'f1': 0.07496145367622375}"", ""{'precision': 0.34705960750579834, 'recall': 0.16323672235012054, 'f1': 0.2547290027141571}"", ""{'precision': -0.04055697098374367, 'recall': 0.13544459640979767, 'f1': 0.047443777322769165}"", ""{'precision': 0.2874433696269989, 'recall': 0.3909418284893036, 'f1': 0.33976122736930847}"", ""{'precision': 0.013704590499401093, 'recall': 0.1261105239391327, 'f1': 0.07079096138477325}"", ""{'precision': 0.0022958312183618546, 'recall': 0.0070695350877940655, 'f1': 0.006298996973782778}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.04759303852915764, 'recall': 0.14297078549861908, 'f1': 0.09630267322063446}"", ""{'precision': 0.5061132907867432, 'recall': 0.3179398477077484, 'f1': 0.4113249182701111}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.3297567069530487, 'recall': 0.20683324337005615, 'f1': 0.268756240606308}"", ""{'precision': 0.0749378353357315, 'recall': 0.11573436856269836, 'f1': 0.09672435373067856}"", ""{'precision': 0.4073179364204407, 'recall': 0.39869120717048645, 'f1': 0.4039713740348816}"", ""{'precision': -0.009095241315662861, 'recall': 0.020507877692580223, 'f1': 0.007277961820363998}"", ""{'precision': -0.06473217904567719, 'recall': -0.034142181277275085, 'f1': -0.047779280692338943}"", ""{'precision': -0.04261331260204315, 'recall': 0.1446707844734192, 'f1': 0.050818946212530136}"", ""{'precision': 0.3305618166923523, 'recall': 0.26773256063461304, 'f1': 0.30009621381759644}"", ""{'precision': -0.031261153519153595, 'recall': 0.018836529925465584, 'f1': -0.004703410901129246}"", ""{'precision': 0.15156836807727814, 'recall': 0.07251915335655212, 'f1': 0.11317533999681473}"", ""{'precision': 0.22911085188388824, 'recall': 0.17426548898220062, 'f1': 0.20283786952495575}"", ""{'precision': 0.24250556528568268, 'recall': 0.2621985375881195, 'f1': 0.2535487413406372}"", ""{'precision': 0.19026708602905273, 'recall': 0.1819763332605362, 'f1': 0.18744036555290222}"", ""{'precision': -0.07508712261915207, 'recall': 0.037153083831071854, 'f1': -0.017948396503925323}"", ""{'precision': 0.2166709154844284, 'recall': 0.17746104300022125, 'f1': 0.19829514622688293}"", ""{'precision': 0.07609530538320541, 'recall': 0.12819607555866241, 'f1': 0.10347115993499756}"", ""{'precision': 0.23566016554832458, 'recall': 0.2002030313014984, 'f1': 0.2191401720046997}"", ""{'precision': 0.039474498480558395, 'recall': 0.03034212253987789, 'f1': 0.03647209703922272}"", ""{'precision': 0.17368051409721375, 'recall': 0.15962590277194977, 'f1': 0.16799703240394592}"", ""{'precision': -0.06723884493112564, 'recall': 0.22073249518871307, 'f1': 0.07412375509738922}"", ""{'precision': 0.13290952146053314, 'recall': 0.07355167716741562, 'f1': 0.1045115739107132}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1231552158867506, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1595867466221573, 0.2816988029230364, 0.0375123027908174, 0.0, 0.121658365925153, 0.0026883850904072, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1601171066931316, 0.0, 0.118127981268613, 0.023413470249148, 0.1743353397675923, 0.017465844953817, 0.0, 0.1669695384489661, 0.1627683104536919, 0.0, 0.0606433872310888, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.1666666666666665, 3.8181818181818183, 1.105263157894737, 4.357142857142857, 8.142857142857142, 8.285714285714286, 6.2, 3.6666666666666665, 1.903225806451613, 1.0285714285714285, 2.5789473684210527, 4.0, 2.8666666666666667, 2.15, 5.8, 4.333333333333333, 2.3, 6.714285714285714, 1.5357142857142858, 2.869565217391304, 1.24, 2.0714285714285716, 3.111111111111111, 1.5454545454545454, 1.037037037037037, 4.714285714285714, 1.2666666666666666, 2.4545454545454546, 2.25, 3.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.10684812068939209, 'recall': 0.03631405159831047, 'f1': 0.07283965498209}"", ""{'precision': 0.18081633746623993, 'recall': 0.21930274367332458, 'f1': 0.20128819346427917}"", ""{'precision': 0.17166095972061157, 'recall': 0.13189461827278137, 'f1': 0.15307734906673431}"", ""{'precision': 0.2035761922597885, 'recall': 0.36162516474723816, 'f1': 0.28257477283477783}"", ""{'precision': -0.007911596447229385, 'recall': 0.07360721379518509, 'f1': 0.03408719226717949}"", ""{'precision': -0.029209056869149208, 'recall': -0.0254511758685112, 'f1': -0.025661807507276535}"", ""{'precision': -0.28529930114746094, 'recall': -0.1471974402666092, 'f1': -0.21527764201164246}"", ""{'precision': 0.06908895075321198, 'recall': 0.19120818376541138, 'f1': 0.1308295577764511}"", ""{'precision': 0.24328982830047607, 'recall': 0.3773156702518463, 'f1': 0.3105713427066803}"", ""{'precision': 0.37962114810943604, 'recall': 0.23239125311374664, 'f1': 0.30609819293022156}"", ""{'precision': 0.14460481703281403, 'recall': 0.2137676626443863, 'f1': 0.18028776347637177}"", ""{'precision': 0.054828621447086334, 'recall': 0.1578940600156784, 'f1': 0.10728989541530609}"", ""{'precision': 0.3231819272041321, 'recall': 0.42914193868637085, 'f1': 0.3766500651836395}"", ""{'precision': 0.06238151714205742, 'recall': 0.07595311105251312, 'f1': 0.07067088782787323}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.040648944675922394, 'recall': 0.0014439028454944491, 'f1': 0.02255857363343239}"", ""{'precision': 0.33503711223602295, 'recall': 0.3662688434123993, 'f1': 0.3516627848148346}"", ""{'precision': -0.0808199793100357, 'recall': 0.04339419677853584, 'f1': -0.017838211730122566}"", ""{'precision': 0.17228850722312927, 'recall': 0.16112887859344482, 'f1': 0.16805635392665863}"", ""{'precision': 0.16065724194049835, 'recall': 0.2842628061771393, 'f1': 0.22298717498779297}"", ""{'precision': 0.19424818456172943, 'recall': 0.25405827164649963, 'f1': 0.22524210810661316}"", ""{'precision': 0.20658765733242035, 'recall': 0.1472964882850647, 'f1': 0.17810629308223724}"", ""{'precision': 0.02119770273566246, 'recall': 0.08223419636487961, 'f1': 0.0530717670917511}"", ""{'precision': 0.3092431426048279, 'recall': 0.23614603281021118, 'f1': 0.273618221282959}"", ""{'precision': 0.15373331308364868, 'recall': 0.1726284623146057, 'f1': 0.16452297568321228}"", ""{'precision': 0.1746618002653122, 'recall': 0.22373667359352112, 'f1': 0.20038409531116486}"", ""{'precision': 0.08880196511745453, 'recall': 0.07461851090192795, 'f1': 0.08319153636693954}"", ""{'precision': 0.1476742923259735, 'recall': 0.07884303480386734, 'f1': 0.11446332186460495}"", ""{'precision': -0.23309831321239471, 'recall': 0.09990908950567245, 'f1': -0.07053916156291962}"", ""{'precision': 0.03019283153116703, 'recall': 0.08091480284929276, 'f1': 0.05696043372154236}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.01413928988305, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.232914392851028, 0.288552621816469, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0777051775670442, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1016052632718472, 0.0, 0.1037397015701301, 0.0456987312059718, 0.0722312220036983, 0.1387480518647602, 0.0, 0.1161288667856411, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0851336600337967, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[5.666666666666667, 2.636363636363636, 2.789473684210526, 3.928571428571429, 6.714285714285714, 6.142857142857143, 7.0, 4.25, 1.4838709677419355, 1.0285714285714285, 2.789473684210526, 3.4, 3.0, 4.9, 5.8, 6.111111111111111, 2.5, 5.142857142857143, 1.5357142857142858, 2.652173913043478, 1.64, 1.1428571428571428, 6.888888888888889, 1.8484848484848484, 3.0, 5.714285714285714, 1.1, 2.909090909090909, 5.125, 2.6818181818181817]","[""{'precision': -0.09311841428279877, 'recall': -0.01294065173715353, 'f1': -0.051645345985889435}"", ""{'precision': 0.2109493762254715, 'recall': 0.20667512714862823, 'f1': 0.21009676158428192}"", ""{'precision': -0.02898159623146057, 'recall': 0.15586157143115997, 'f1': 0.0632597804069519}"", ""{'precision': 0.25616416335105896, 'recall': 0.3921296298503876, 'f1': 0.32437044382095337}"", ""{'precision': -0.03161277994513512, 'recall': 0.057851266115903854, 'f1': 0.014321071095764637}"", ""{'precision': -0.03530910238623619, 'recall': 0.05106435716152191, 'f1': 0.009115110151469707}"", ""{'precision': -0.35257774591445923, 'recall': -0.09080387651920319, 'f1': -0.22332797944545746}"", ""{'precision': 0.01716284081339836, 'recall': 0.16772548854351044, 'f1': 0.09279683977365494}"", ""{'precision': 0.3477271497249603, 'recall': 0.3651588559150696, 'f1': 0.35747477412223816}"", ""{'precision': 0.4063907563686371, 'recall': 0.23384788632392883, 'f1': 0.3198058307170868}"", ""{'precision': 0.09873276203870773, 'recall': 0.18228335678577423, 'f1': 0.14156284928321838}"", ""{'precision': 0.09469754993915558, 'recall': 0.19298988580703735, 'f1': 0.14476250112056732}"", ""{'precision': 0.32154300808906555, 'recall': 0.36767488718032837, 'f1': 0.345574289560318}"", ""{'precision': -0.08242210745811462, 'recall': 0.07026062160730362, 'f1': -0.005622691474854946}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.0636489987373352, 'recall': 0.29298919439315796, 'f1': 0.17709165811538696}"", ""{'precision': 0.32472991943359375, 'recall': 0.4210628569126129, 'f1': 0.37348079681396484}"", ""{'precision': 0.011358527466654778, 'recall': 0.052887097001075745, 'f1': 0.03360971808433533}"", ""{'precision': 0.17086820304393768, 'recall': 0.14884509146213531, 'f1': 0.16119760274887085}"", ""{'precision': 0.18676285445690155, 'recall': 0.2741827070713043, 'f1': 0.23135605454444885}"", ""{'precision': 0.01473683025687933, 'recall': 0.23198658227920532, 'f1': 0.1224624440073967}"", ""{'precision': 0.31424480676651, 'recall': 0.09978776425123215, 'f1': 0.2060675323009491}"", ""{'precision': -0.09696684777736664, 'recall': 0.08984457701444626, 'f1': -0.0036923084408044815}"", ""{'precision': 0.2577022612094879, 'recall': 0.20712047815322876, 'f1': 0.23353365063667297}"", ""{'precision': 0.04533824324607849, 'recall': 0.1415725201368332, 'f1': 0.09447082877159119}"", ""{'precision': 0.15169040858745575, 'recall': 0.21877674758434296, 'f1': 0.18633955717086792}"", ""{'precision': 0.09471594542264938, 'recall': 0.08893232047557831, 'f1': 0.09329762309789658}"", ""{'precision': 0.13611166179180145, 'recall': 0.09732230752706528, 'f1': 0.11807652562856674}"", ""{'precision': -0.1604962795972824, 'recall': 0.15840131044387817, 'f1': -0.00455790851265192}"", ""{'precision': 0.08433659374713898, 'recall': 0.07663544267416, 'f1': 0.08197701722383499}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1035056673507767, 0.0671608869518552, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2584050114622343, 0.3223659397724296, 0.138290599624506, 0.0, 0.1969509557508073, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0986639785766601, 0.0, 0.0018812325738725, 0.0822918270022972, 0.0246503920127183, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0802679530882732, 0.1523317510883013, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0576822277357025]","[3.9166666666666665, 3.636363636363636, 0.4736842105263157, 3.4285714285714284, 10.0, 4.285714285714286, 3.8, 2.5833333333333335, 1.3548387096774193, 0.8857142857142857, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7333333333333334, 2.4, 5.35, 11.0, 4.888888888888889, 2.9, 2.7142857142857144, 1.9642857142857144, 2.260869565217391, 2.0, 2.2857142857142856, 4.333333333333333, 2.060606060606061, 0.925925925925926, 5.0, 1.7666666666666666, 4.2727272727272725, 8.875, 1.5454545454545454]","[""{'precision': 0.018605075776576996, 'recall': 0.027676809579133987, 'f1': 0.024723809212446213}"", ""{'precision': 0.11408830434083939, 'recall': 0.12945179641246796, 'f1': 0.12318607419729233}"", ""{'precision': -0.044818583875894547, 'recall': 0.039317525923252106, 'f1': -0.0014776296447962523}"", ""{'precision': 0.28842395544052124, 'recall': 0.400706022977829, 'f1': 0.3450360596179962}"", ""{'precision': -0.05558670684695244, 'recall': 0.05271483585238457, 'f1': -0.00039977935375645757}"", ""{'precision': 0.16830281913280487, 'recall': 0.07726295292377472, 'f1': 0.12379739433526993}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.017596537247300148, 'recall': 0.0009918430587276816, 'f1': 0.010889396071434021}"", ""{'precision': 0.3915248215198517, 'recall': 0.3192733824253082, 'f1': 0.35619881749153137}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.22101496160030365, 'recall': 0.1334792971611023, 'f1': 0.17820799350738525}"", ""{'precision': 0.1150352880358696, 'recall': 0.19117280840873718, 'f1': 0.1541975736618042}"", ""{'precision': 0.40110504627227783, 'recall': 0.40135687589645386, 'f1': 0.4022037982940674}"", ""{'precision': -0.0658365860581398, 'recall': 0.0735541507601738, 'f1': 0.004498577211052179}"", ""{'precision': -0.07433929294347763, 'recall': -0.10522875189781189, 'f1': -0.08806341141462326}"", ""{'precision': 0.06748929619789124, 'recall': 0.10652444511651993, 'f1': 0.08841516077518463}"", ""{'precision': 0.3841123580932617, 'recall': 0.2892446517944336, 'f1': 0.3373279571533203}"", ""{'precision': 0.03829863667488098, 'recall': 0.039665237069129944, 'f1': 0.04054334759712219}"", ""{'precision': 0.0621151439845562, 'recall': 0.06140831857919693, 'f1': 0.06328627467155457}"", ""{'precision': 0.2234218567609787, 'recall': 0.2235700637102127, 'f1': 0.22475756704807281}"", ""{'precision': 0.09432080388069153, 'recall': 0.19741639494895935, 'f1': 0.14673668146133423}"", ""{'precision': 0.17018228769302368, 'recall': 0.17701993882656097, 'f1': 0.17494195699691772}"", ""{'precision': -0.05711100995540619, 'recall': 0.15987704694271088, 'f1': 0.05057244002819061}"", ""{'precision': 0.1795092225074768, 'recall': 0.22820739448070526, 'f1': 0.20503807067871094}"", ""{'precision': 0.17392954230308533, 'recall': 0.1660403460264206, 'f1': 0.17133016884326935}"", ""{'precision': 0.24478335678577423, 'recall': 0.23942787945270538, 'f1': 0.2433353066444397}"", ""{'precision': 0.051276274025440216, 'recall': 0.03819303587079048, 'f1': 0.04627799242734909}"", ""{'precision': 0.0014669972006231546, 'recall': 0.09220745414495468, 'f1': 0.04797528684139252}"", ""{'precision': -0.14923645555973053, 'recall': 0.13711276650428772, 'f1': -0.008572653867304325}"", ""{'precision': 0.06578033417463303, 'recall': 0.1044427752494812, 'f1': 0.08652433007955551}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use (with examples): ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Format your answer as follows: (Teaching Method) (Response) Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.280274337093472, 0.0595901505578131, 0.0634508564975691, 0.0, 0.1072481046120325, 0.2331032305449905, 0.1887971609447683, 0.4482468976384072, 0.218167631398606, 0.2372445311148961, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1737546155282429, 0.1121535111154828, 0.1455629308592705, 0.2691694521503486, 0.0387265856899321, 0.1543118895803178, 0.1429861229229596, 0.2223921435844164, 0.1244109327523227, 0.0, 0.1376201412853196, 0.0359484198870081, 0.0885679996609688, 0.1497610494494438]","[2.4166666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 1.7142857142857142, 1.8571428571428572, 2.142857142857143, 2.4, 1.5833333333333333, 0.8064516129032258, 0.3714285714285714, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 3.0, 1.8888888888888888, 1.7, 2.4285714285714284, 1.1071428571428572, 0.9130434782608696, 0.56, 1.4285714285714286, 0.7777777777777778, 0.8181818181818182, 1.2592592592592593, 1.8571428571428572, 0.5333333333333333, 2.090909090909091, 1.875, 0.9090909090909092]","[""{'precision': 0.13864237070083618, 'recall': 0.22377946972846985, 'f1': 0.18218955397605896}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.29420068860054016, 'recall': 0.45664507150650024, 'f1': 0.37520068883895874}"", ""{'precision': 0.13351726531982422, 'recall': 0.29529616236686707, 'f1': 0.21441839635372162}"", ""{'precision': 0.29231661558151245, 'recall': 0.2771975100040436, 'f1': 0.28590792417526245}"", ""{'precision': -0.16725677251815796, 'recall': -0.02978040836751461, 'f1': -0.09770578891038895}"", ""{'precision': 0.218782439827919, 'recall': 0.24108827114105225, 'f1': 0.2311628758907318}"", ""{'precision': 0.24765720963478088, 'recall': 0.2681216597557068, 'f1': 0.25907573103904724}"", ""{'precision': 0.17579273879528046, 'recall': 0.0702231302857399, 'f1': 0.12388003617525101}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.08622314035892487, 'recall': 0.32667577266693115, 'f1': 0.2049374133348465}"", ""{'precision': 0.25753599405288696, 'recall': 0.3161171078681946, 'f1': 0.2878223955631256}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.13379955291748047, 'recall': 0.09721406549215317, 'f1': 0.11687683314085007}"", ""{'precision': 0.015880854800343513, 'recall': 0.0830654427409172, 'f1': 0.05079316720366478}"", ""{'precision': 0.23008720576763153, 'recall': 0.4026769995689392, 'f1': 0.31608065962791443}"", ""{'precision': 0.296329528093338, 'recall': 0.46848103404045105, 'f1': 0.38202130794525146}"", ""{'precision': 0.12538881599903107, 'recall': 0.12354177236557007, 'f1': 0.12588776648044586}"", ""{'precision': 0.3607337772846222, 'recall': 0.31556951999664307, 'f1': 0.33912941813468933}"", ""{'precision': -0.07983797043561935, 'recall': 0.057360295206308365, 'f1': -0.010546828620135784}"", ""{'precision': 0.31597214937210083, 'recall': 0.2876557409763336, 'f1': 0.3029094934463501}"", ""{'precision': 0.09233592450618744, 'recall': 0.2008637934923172, 'f1': 0.14741015434265137}"", ""{'precision': 0.22945044934749603, 'recall': 0.2754858434200287, 'f1': 0.2535819411277771}"", ""{'precision': 0.1828542798757553, 'recall': 0.2094971388578415, 'f1': 0.19744791090488434}"", ""{'precision': 0.10266786813735962, 'recall': 0.19699440896511078, 'f1': 0.1507779061794281}"", ""{'precision': 0.10981395095586777, 'recall': 0.047144029289484024, 'f1': 0.07977928966283798}"", ""{'precision': 0.09698135405778885, 'recall': 0.290243923664093, 'f1': 0.1931089609861374}"", ""{'precision': 0.07298797369003296, 'recall': 0.2475324124097824, 'f1': 0.16013599932193756}"", ""{'precision': 0.09527769684791565, 'recall': 0.10083868354558945, 'f1': 0.09952209889888763}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.2669455055034522, 0.1581181829122075, 0.0602024057870188, 0.0369230996710913, 0.0334222354874107, 0.0, 0.0172822121316674, 0.2822177794147447, 0.1264396151914723, 0.4482468976384072, 0.2166361496557471, 0.2112315144141515, 0.1459739334646024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1458772459155634, 0.0484547153022719, 0.0976198112765639, 0.1287198804729226, 0.0252047787261781, 0.0963881797449929, 0.0319340280246817, 0.2765885904901324, 0.0176132574100486, 0.0, 0.1542999093435335, 0.2538067443387491, 0.0, 0.1461071665346364]","[2.1666666666666665, 1.4545454545454546, 0.5263157894736842, 2.7142857142857144, 1.7142857142857142, 2.142857142857143, 1.4, 1.3333333333333333, 0.3870967741935484, 0.6285714285714286, 0.7894736842105263, 1.1333333333333333, 1.0666666666666669, 0.8, 4.8, 1.5555555555555556, 2.7, 2.142857142857143, 0.6071428571428571, 1.608695652173913, 1.2, 1.7857142857142858, 1.1111111111111112, 0.4545454545454545, 1.4074074074074074, 3.2857142857142856, 0.5333333333333333, 1.3636363636363635, 5.125, 0.8181818181818182]","[""{'precision': 0.11144650727510452, 'recall': 0.16678740084171295, 'f1': 0.1403663456439972}"", ""{'precision': 0.2975064516067505, 'recall': 0.4180378317832947, 'f1': 0.3581334352493286}"", ""{'precision': 0.11275431513786316, 'recall': 0.22203561663627625, 'f1': 0.16816619038581848}"", ""{'precision': 0.16733106970787048, 'recall': 0.34498879313468933, 'f1': 0.2558545470237732}"", ""{'precision': 0.14777971804141998, 'recall': 0.12287995219230652, 'f1': 0.13670334219932556}"", ""{'precision': 0.14047302305698395, 'recall': 0.16943396627902985, 'f1': 0.15628546476364136}"", ""{'precision': -0.1741969883441925, 'recall': -0.2152625024318695, 'f1': -0.19287870824337006}"", ""{'precision': 0.10095961391925812, 'recall': -0.010690257884562016, 'f1': 0.04605867713689804}"", ""{'precision': 0.4403025507926941, 'recall': 0.15784242749214172, 'f1': 0.29640036821365356}"", ""{'precision': 0.1082160696387291, 'recall': -0.02357855811715126, 'f1': 0.043000295758247375}"", ""{'precision': 0.4360978901386261, 'recall': 0.3686020076274872, 'f1': 0.4031064808368683}"", ""{'precision': 0.0672667920589447, 'recall': 0.34117069840431213, 'f1': 0.20187444984912872}"", ""{'precision': 0.21142058074474335, 'recall': 0.2578919529914856, 'f1': 0.23579636216163635}"", ""{'precision': 0.1130005270242691, 'recall': 0.135466530919075, 'f1': 0.12563207745552063}"", ""{'precision': 0.07662168145179749, 'recall': -0.05927005410194397, 'f1': 0.00935102254152298}"", ""{'precision': -0.02370366081595421, 'recall': -0.02631603181362152, 'f1': -0.02334471233189106}"", ""{'precision': 0.3802837133407593, 'recall': 0.37594321370124817, 'f1': 0.37912291288375854}"", ""{'precision': 0.22057241201400757, 'recall': 0.2892892360687256, 'f1': 0.25591564178466797}"", ""{'precision': 0.13475148379802704, 'recall': -0.040554143488407135, 'f1': 0.047102976590394974}"", ""{'precision': 0.2246946543455124, 'recall': 0.10567621141672134, 'f1': 0.16584555804729462}"", ""{'precision': -0.022776130586862564, 'recall': 0.083047054708004, 'f1': 0.031150298193097115}"", ""{'precision': 0.2631351351737976, 'recall': 0.2743387222290039, 'f1': 0.269919216632843}"", ""{'precision': -0.08870362490415573, 'recall': 0.10129321366548538, 'f1': 0.006090278271585703}"", ""{'precision': 0.42749470472335815, 'recall': 0.1397526115179062, 'f1': 0.28082096576690674}"", ""{'precision': 0.06014829874038696, 'recall': 0.12220893800258636, 'f1': 0.09246557205915451}"", ""{'precision': 0.2430046945810318, 'recall': 0.3270018994808197, 'f1': 0.2858295142650604}"", ""{'precision': 0.14836622774600983, 'recall': 0.00877873133867979, 'f1': 0.07909627258777618}"", ""{'precision': 0.2596312463283539, 'recall': 0.2833509147167206, 'f1': 0.2726484537124634}"", ""{'precision': -0.04212549328804016, 'recall': 0.2262428104877472, 'f1': 0.0899641290307045}"", ""{'precision': 0.13963252305984497, 'recall': 0.06494591385126114, 'f1': 0.10346974432468414}""]","['(Seeking Self Correction) Are you sure Randi received 10 cents?

Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods to use: ### Focus: - Seek Strategy (So what should you do next?) - Guiding Student Focus (Can you calculate ...?) - Recall Relevant Information (Can you reread the question and tell me what is ...?)  ### Probing: - Asking for Explanation (Why do you think you need to add these numbers?) - Seeking Self Correction (Are you sure you need to add here?) - Perturbing the Question (How would things change if they had ... items instead?) - Seeking World Knowledge (How do you calculate the perimeter of a square?)  ### Telling: - Revealing Strategy (You need to add ... to ... to get your answer.) - Revealing Answer (No, he had ... items.)  ### Generic: - Greeting/Farewell (Hi ..., how are you doing with the word problem? || Good Job! Is there anything else I can help with?) - General Inquiry (Can you go walk me through your solution?)  Directly answer the student's question.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.1387281377207149, 0.0326287712524776, 0.0931273669314074, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3685939814893283, 0.3223659397724296, 0.2835382546816534, 0.0353186986044697, 0.2098288242723427, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1303345371663271, 0.1411195762450153, 0.2307743706703186, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1447803716874165, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0144460941817118, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.0833333333333335, 1.6363636363636365, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7857142857142856, 5.142857142857143, 8.285714285714286, 3.8, 3.6666666666666665, 0.7741935483870968, 0.8857142857142857, 1.2105263157894737, 2.0, 2.3333333333333335, 2.75, 6.8, 6.888888888888889, 3.7, 5.571428571428571, 0.9642857142857144, 1.6521739130434785, 0.92, 3.2857142857142856, 5.111111111111111, 1.4848484848484849, 2.2222222222222223, 4.571428571428571, 1.3666666666666667, 2.727272727272727, 8.75, 2.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.11432495713233948, 'recall': 0.03324726223945618, 'f1': 0.07496145367622375}"", ""{'precision': 0.34705960750579834, 'recall': 0.16323672235012054, 'f1': 0.2547290027141571}"", ""{'precision': -0.04055697098374367, 'recall': 0.13544459640979767, 'f1': 0.047443777322769165}"", ""{'precision': 0.2874433696269989, 'recall': 0.3909418284893036, 'f1': 0.33976122736930847}"", ""{'precision': 0.013704590499401093, 'recall': 0.1261105239391327, 'f1': 0.07079096138477325}"", ""{'precision': 0.0022958312183618546, 'recall': 0.0070695350877940655, 'f1': 0.006298996973782778}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.04759303852915764, 'recall': 0.14297078549861908, 'f1': 0.09630267322063446}"", ""{'precision': 0.5061132907867432, 'recall': 0.3179398477077484, 'f1': 0.4113249182701111}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.3297567069530487, 'recall': 0.20683324337005615, 'f1': 0.268756240606308}"", ""{'precision': 0.0749378353357315, 'recall': 0.11573436856269836, 'f1': 0.09672435373067856}"", ""{'precision': 0.4073179364204407, 'recall': 0.39869120717048645, 'f1': 0.4039713740348816}"", ""{'precision': -0.009095241315662861, 'recall': 0.020507877692580223, 'f1': 0.007277961820363998}"", ""{'precision': -0.06473217904567719, 'recall': -0.034142181277275085, 'f1': -0.047779280692338943}"", ""{'precision': -0.04261331260204315, 'recall': 0.1446707844734192, 'f1': 0.050818946212530136}"", ""{'precision': 0.3305618166923523, 'recall': 0.26773256063461304, 'f1': 0.30009621381759644}"", ""{'precision': -0.031261153519153595, 'recall': 0.018836529925465584, 'f1': -0.004703410901129246}"", ""{'precision': 0.15156836807727814, 'recall': 0.07251915335655212, 'f1': 0.11317533999681473}"", ""{'precision': 0.22911085188388824, 'recall': 0.17426548898220062, 'f1': 0.20283786952495575}"", ""{'precision': 0.24250556528568268, 'recall': 0.2621985375881195, 'f1': 0.2535487413406372}"", ""{'precision': 0.19026708602905273, 'recall': 0.1819763332605362, 'f1': 0.18744036555290222}"", ""{'precision': -0.07508712261915207, 'recall': 0.037153083831071854, 'f1': -0.017948396503925323}"", ""{'precision': 0.2166709154844284, 'recall': 0.17746104300022125, 'f1': 0.19829514622688293}"", ""{'precision': 0.07609530538320541, 'recall': 0.12819607555866241, 'f1': 0.10347115993499756}"", ""{'precision': 0.23566016554832458, 'recall': 0.2002030313014984, 'f1': 0.2191401720046997}"", ""{'precision': 0.039474498480558395, 'recall': 0.03034212253987789, 'f1': 0.03647209703922272}"", ""{'precision': 0.17368051409721375, 'recall': 0.15962590277194977, 'f1': 0.16799703240394592}"", ""{'precision': -0.06723884493112564, 'recall': 0.22073249518871307, 'f1': 0.07412375509738922}"", ""{'precision': 0.13290952146053314, 'recall': 0.07355167716741562, 'f1': 0.1045115739107132}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1231552158867506, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1595867466221573, 0.2816988029230364, 0.0375123027908174, 0.0, 0.121658365925153, 0.0026883850904072, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1601171066931316, 0.0, 0.118127981268613, 0.023413470249148, 0.1743353397675923, 0.017465844953817, 0.0, 0.1669695384489661, 0.1627683104536919, 0.0, 0.0606433872310888, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[3.1666666666666665, 3.8181818181818183, 1.105263157894737, 4.357142857142857, 8.142857142857142, 8.285714285714286, 6.2, 3.6666666666666665, 1.903225806451613, 1.0285714285714285, 2.5789473684210527, 4.0, 2.8666666666666667, 2.15, 5.8, 4.333333333333333, 2.3, 6.714285714285714, 1.5357142857142858, 2.869565217391304, 1.24, 2.0714285714285716, 3.111111111111111, 1.5454545454545454, 1.037037037037037, 4.714285714285714, 1.2666666666666666, 2.4545454545454546, 2.25, 3.272727272727273]","[""{'precision': 0.10684812068939209, 'recall': 0.03631405159831047, 'f1': 0.07283965498209}"", ""{'precision': 0.18081633746623993, 'recall': 0.21930274367332458, 'f1': 0.20128819346427917}"", ""{'precision': 0.17166095972061157, 'recall': 0.13189461827278137, 'f1': 0.15307734906673431}"", ""{'precision': 0.2035761922597885, 'recall': 0.36162516474723816, 'f1': 0.28257477283477783}"", ""{'precision': -0.007911596447229385, 'recall': 0.07360721379518509, 'f1': 0.03408719226717949}"", ""{'precision': -0.029209056869149208, 'recall': -0.0254511758685112, 'f1': -0.025661807507276535}"", ""{'precision': -0.28529930114746094, 'recall': -0.1471974402666092, 'f1': -0.21527764201164246}"", ""{'precision': 0.06908895075321198, 'recall': 0.19120818376541138, 'f1': 0.1308295577764511}"", ""{'precision': 0.24328982830047607, 'recall': 0.3773156702518463, 'f1': 0.3105713427066803}"", ""{'precision': 0.37962114810943604, 'recall': 0.23239125311374664, 'f1': 0.30609819293022156}"", ""{'precision': 0.14460481703281403, 'recall': 0.2137676626443863, 'f1': 0.18028776347637177}"", ""{'precision': 0.054828621447086334, 'recall': 0.1578940600156784, 'f1': 0.10728989541530609}"", ""{'precision': 0.3231819272041321, 'recall': 0.42914193868637085, 'f1': 0.3766500651836395}"", ""{'precision': 0.06238151714205742, 'recall': 0.07595311105251312, 'f1': 0.07067088782787323}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.040648944675922394, 'recall': 0.0014439028454944491, 'f1': 0.02255857363343239}"", ""{'precision': 0.33503711223602295, 'recall': 0.3662688434123993, 'f1': 0.3516627848148346}"", ""{'precision': -0.0808199793100357, 'recall': 0.04339419677853584, 'f1': -0.017838211730122566}"", ""{'precision': 0.17228850722312927, 'recall': 0.16112887859344482, 'f1': 0.16805635392665863}"", ""{'precision': 0.16065724194049835, 'recall': 0.2842628061771393, 'f1': 0.22298717498779297}"", ""{'precision': 0.19424818456172943, 'recall': 0.25405827164649963, 'f1': 0.22524210810661316}"", ""{'precision': 0.20658765733242035, 'recall': 0.1472964882850647, 'f1': 0.17810629308223724}"", ""{'precision': 0.02119770273566246, 'recall': 0.08223419636487961, 'f1': 0.0530717670917511}"", ""{'precision': 0.3092431426048279, 'recall': 0.23614603281021118, 'f1': 0.273618221282959}"", ""{'precision': 0.15373331308364868, 'recall': 0.1726284623146057, 'f1': 0.16452297568321228}"", ""{'precision': 0.1746618002653122, 'recall': 0.22373667359352112, 'f1': 0.20038409531116486}"", ""{'precision': 0.08880196511745453, 'recall': 0.07461851090192795, 'f1': 0.08319153636693954}"", ""{'precision': 0.1476742923259735, 'recall': 0.07884303480386734, 'f1': 0.11446332186460495}"", ""{'precision': -0.23309831321239471, 'recall': 0.09990908950567245, 'f1': -0.07053916156291962}"", ""{'precision': 0.03019283153116703, 'recall': 0.08091480284929276, 'f1': 0.05696043372154236}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.01413928988305, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.232914392851028, 0.288552621816469, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0777051775670442, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1016052632718472, 0.0, 0.1037397015701301, 0.0456987312059718, 0.0722312220036983, 0.1387480518647602, 0.0, 0.1161288667856411, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0851336600337967, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[5.666666666666667, 2.636363636363636, 2.789473684210526, 3.928571428571429, 6.714285714285714, 6.142857142857143, 7.0, 4.25, 1.4838709677419355, 1.0285714285714285, 2.789473684210526, 3.4, 3.0, 4.9, 5.8, 6.111111111111111, 2.5, 5.142857142857143, 1.5357142857142858, 2.652173913043478, 1.64, 1.1428571428571428, 6.888888888888889, 1.8484848484848484, 3.0, 5.714285714285714, 1.1, 2.909090909090909, 5.125, 2.6818181818181817]","[""{'precision': -0.09311841428279877, 'recall': -0.01294065173715353, 'f1': -0.051645345985889435}"", ""{'precision': 0.2109493762254715, 'recall': 0.20667512714862823, 'f1': 0.21009676158428192}"", ""{'precision': -0.02898159623146057, 'recall': 0.15586157143115997, 'f1': 0.0632597804069519}"", ""{'precision': 0.25616416335105896, 'recall': 0.3921296298503876, 'f1': 0.32437044382095337}"", ""{'precision': -0.03161277994513512, 'recall': 0.057851266115903854, 'f1': 0.014321071095764637}"", ""{'precision': -0.03530910238623619, 'recall': 0.05106435716152191, 'f1': 0.009115110151469707}"", ""{'precision': -0.35257774591445923, 'recall': -0.09080387651920319, 'f1': -0.22332797944545746}"", ""{'precision': 0.01716284081339836, 'recall': 0.16772548854351044, 'f1': 0.09279683977365494}"", ""{'precision': 0.3477271497249603, 'recall': 0.3651588559150696, 'f1': 0.35747477412223816}"", ""{'precision': 0.4063907563686371, 'recall': 0.23384788632392883, 'f1': 0.3198058307170868}"", ""{'precision': 0.09873276203870773, 'recall': 0.18228335678577423, 'f1': 0.14156284928321838}"", ""{'precision': 0.09469754993915558, 'recall': 0.19298988580703735, 'f1': 0.14476250112056732}"", ""{'precision': 0.32154300808906555, 'recall': 0.36767488718032837, 'f1': 0.345574289560318}"", ""{'precision': -0.08242210745811462, 'recall': 0.07026062160730362, 'f1': -0.005622691474854946}"", ""{'precision': -0.037150368094444275, 'recall': -0.11353491246700287, 'f1': -0.07389701902866364}"", ""{'precision': 0.0636489987373352, 'recall': 0.29298919439315796, 'f1': 0.17709165811538696}"", ""{'precision': 0.32472991943359375, 'recall': 0.4210628569126129, 'f1': 0.37348079681396484}"", ""{'precision': 0.011358527466654778, 'recall': 0.052887097001075745, 'f1': 0.03360971808433533}"", ""{'precision': 0.17086820304393768, 'recall': 0.14884509146213531, 'f1': 0.16119760274887085}"", ""{'precision': 0.18676285445690155, 'recall': 0.2741827070713043, 'f1': 0.23135605454444885}"", ""{'precision': 0.01473683025687933, 'recall': 0.23198658227920532, 'f1': 0.1224624440073967}"", ""{'precision': 0.31424480676651, 'recall': 0.09978776425123215, 'f1': 0.2060675323009491}"", ""{'precision': -0.09696684777736664, 'recall': 0.08984457701444626, 'f1': -0.0036923084408044815}"", ""{'precision': 0.2577022612094879, 'recall': 0.20712047815322876, 'f1': 0.23353365063667297}"", ""{'precision': 0.04533824324607849, 'recall': 0.1415725201368332, 'f1': 0.09447082877159119}"", ""{'precision': 0.15169040858745575, 'recall': 0.21877674758434296, 'f1': 0.18633955717086792}"", ""{'precision': 0.09471594542264938, 'recall': 0.08893232047557831, 'f1': 0.09329762309789658}"", ""{'precision': 0.13611166179180145, 'recall': 0.09732230752706528, 'f1': 0.11807652562856674}"", ""{'precision': -0.1604962795972824, 'recall': 0.15840131044387817, 'f1': -0.00455790851265192}"", ""{'precision': 0.08433659374713898, 'recall': 0.07663544267416, 'f1': 0.08197701722383499}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  ## Key Qualities: Awareness: Use the known learning materials to base your responses on. Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them. Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps. Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high. Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs. Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning. Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding. No Unnecessary Praise: Avoid excessive praise to maintain a authentic and constructive learning environment. Conversation Flow: Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material. Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.  Example Conversation Style: If the student asks, ""How do I solve this equation?"" respond with: ""Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"". Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.  ## Flexibility: Restrict your response's length to quickly resolve the student's query. However, adjust your approach dynamically, if the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.  ## Governance: You are a chatbot deployed in Lambda Feedback, an online self-study platform. You are discussing with students from Imperial College London.

"You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.  ## Teaching Methods: Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time. Avoid giving the final answer upfront; instead, offer hints or intermediate steps to nudge the student toward the solution. Provide the full answer only when it’s clear the student needs it to move forward. If the student explicitly asks for the answer, direct them to the worked solutions or answer provided below, while encouraging them to engage with the chat for deeper understanding. Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them. Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process. Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress. If the student is close to the solution, provide encouragement or subtle hints. If they seem stuck, gradually increase the specificity of your support.  Directly answer the student's question. Keep your answer short.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.1035056673507767, 0.0671608869518552, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2584050114622343, 0.3223659397724296, 0.138290599624506, 0.0, 0.1969509557508073, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0986639785766601, 0.0, 0.0018812325738725, 0.0822918270022972, 0.0246503920127183, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0802679530882732, 0.1523317510883013, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0576822277357025]","[3.9166666666666665, 3.636363636363636, 0.4736842105263157, 3.4285714285714284, 10.0, 4.285714285714286, 3.8, 2.5833333333333335, 1.3548387096774193, 0.8857142857142857, 1.5263157894736843, 2.7333333333333334, 2.4, 5.35, 11.0, 4.888888888888889, 2.9, 2.7142857142857144, 1.9642857142857144, 2.260869565217391, 2.0, 2.2857142857142856, 4.333333333333333, 2.060606060606061, 0.925925925925926, 5.0, 1.7666666666666666, 4.2727272727272725, 8.875, 1.5454545454545454]","[""{'precision': 0.018605075776576996, 'recall': 0.027676809579133987, 'f1': 0.024723809212446213}"", ""{'precision': 0.11408830434083939, 'recall': 0.12945179641246796, 'f1': 0.12318607419729233}"", ""{'precision': -0.044818583875894547, 'recall': 0.039317525923252106, 'f1': -0.0014776296447962523}"", ""{'precision': 0.28842395544052124, 'recall': 0.400706022977829, 'f1': 0.3450360596179962}"", ""{'precision': -0.05558670684695244, 'recall': 0.05271483585238457, 'f1': -0.00039977935375645757}"", ""{'precision': 0.16830281913280487, 'recall': 0.07726295292377472, 'f1': 0.12379739433526993}"", ""{'precision': -0.2712933123111725, 'recall': -0.15004774928092957, 'f1': -0.20947732031345367}"", ""{'precision': 0.017596537247300148, 'recall': 0.0009918430587276816, 'f1': 0.010889396071434021}"", ""{'precision': 0.3915248215198517, 'recall': 0.3192733824253082, 'f1': 0.35619881749153137}"", ""{'precision': 0.450145959854126, 'recall': 0.2312968224287033, 'f1': 0.3395217955112457}"", ""{'precision': 0.22101496160030365, 'recall': 0.1334792971611023, 'f1': 0.17820799350738525}"", ""{'precision': 0.1150352880358696, 'recall': 0.19117280840873718, 'f1': 0.1541975736618042}"", ""{'precision': 0.40110504627227783, 'recall': 0.40135687589645386, 'f1': 0.4022037982940674}"", ""{'precision': -0.0658365860581398, 'recall': 0.0735541507601738, 'f1': 0.004498577211052179}"", ""{'precision': -0.07433929294347763, 'recall': -0.10522875189781189, 'f1': -0.08806341141462326}"", ""{'precision': 0.06748929619789124, 'recall': 0.10652444511651993, 'f1': 0.08841516077518463}"", ""{'precision': 0.3841123580932617, 'recall': 0.2892446517944336, 'f1': 0.3373279571533203}"", ""{'precision': 0.03829863667488098, 'recall': 0.039665237069129944, 'f1': 0.04054334759712219}"", ""{'precision': 0.0621151439845562, 'recall': 0.06140831857919693, 'f1': 0.06328627467155457}"", ""{'precision': 0.2234218567609787, 'recall': 0.2235700637102127, 'f1': 0.22475756704807281}"", ""{'precision': 0.09432080388069153, 'recall': 0.19741639494895935, 'f1': 0.14673668146133423}"", ""{'precision': 0.17018228769302368, 'recall': 0.17701993882656097, 'f1': 0.17494195699691772}"", ""{'precision': -0.05711100995540619, 'recall': 0.15987704694271088, 'f1': 0.05057244002819061}"", ""{'precision': 0.1795092225074768, 'recall': 0.22820739448070526, 'f1': 0.20503807067871094}"", ""{'precision': 0.17392954230308533, 'recall': 0.1660403460264206, 'f1': 0.17133016884326935}"", ""{'precision': 0.24478335678577423, 'recall': 0.23942787945270538, 'f1': 0.2433353066444397}"", ""{'precision': 0.051276274025440216, 'recall': 0.03819303587079048, 'f1': 0.04627799242734909}"", ""{'precision': 0.0014669972006231546, 'recall': 0.09220745414495468, 'f1': 0.04797528684139252}"", ""{'precision': -0.14923645555973053, 'recall': 0.13711276650428772, 'f1': -0.008572653867304325}"", ""{'precision': 0.06578033417463303, 'recall': 0.1044427752494812, 'f1': 0.08652433007955551}""]","['You correctly calculated the number of nickels Ray had initially and the number he gave to Peter.

This equation seems to be adding Tyler's and Sam's weights together and setting that equal to Tyler's weight. But the problem only states that Tyler weighs 25 pounds more than Sam, and Peter weighs half as much as Tyler.  Instead of combining their weights, focus on the direct relationships given in the problem. You've already correctly found Tyler's weight. Now, use the information about the difference between Tyler's and Sam's weights to find Sam's weight."", 'It looks like you divided by the number of books instead of considering the total reading time needed across all books within the 10 days.  Think about it this way: You know the total number of words and her reading speed. Can you use that to find the total time she needs to spend reading?', ""You're on the right track with calculating the total cards and understanding he tears cards multiple times a week. However, you are calculating the number of tears incorrectly. Jame tears 30 cards each time. Think about how many cards he tears in a week."", 'You correctly calculated the number of trees cut down and the number of new trees planted. However, remember to account for the trees that were removed from the farm.', ""You're calculating the total number of colored pencils, but the problem asks specifically about the number of red pencils."", 'You correctly calculated the number of televisions sold in Year 1 (this year), Year 2, and Year 3. However, the question asks about the number of televisions sold on Black Friday *three years from now*. You stopped at Year 3, but you need to calculate one more year to find the answer to the question.', 'You correctly calculated the number of twigs the bird wants to add (72) and the number of twigs the tree dropped (24). However, you incorrectly included the original 12 twigs when calculating the number of twigs dropped by the tree. The tree only drops twigs for the ones the bird still needs.', ""It looks like you're on the right track! However, the problem states that Kate sold the wands for $5 more than she *paid*. This means the $5 profit should be based on the original cost of the wands to Kate, not on some other value.  Keep going, you're doing great!"", ""It looks like you're on the right track, but there's a slight misunderstanding of the problem. Harry wants to buy *exactly* 14 balloons. With your approach, how many balloons would he have?"", ""You've already identified and corrected your mistake! You initially subtracted 100 from 120 before dividing by 40, but you realized you should directly divide the target mileage (120) by the number of weeks (40) to find the weekly increase."", ""It looks like you've correctly calculated the area of the lawn and the total coverage of the grass seed. However, your conclusion seems to be where the error lies. You've determined that since the grass seed is enough to cover the lawn, there's no leftover, but have you considered what the question is asking?  The question asks how many *extra* square feet the *leftover* grass seed could cover."", ""It looks like you're recalculating the original amount, but the question already tells you how many pages he reads per week at his original speed."", 'You correctly calculated the money Danielle has left for juice and the number of popsicles she can make. However, think about how the number of popsicles relates to the number of popsicle sticks she uses.', ""You're on the right track, but it looks like you combined the number of butter cookies and biscuits too early in the process. Remember, the question asks for the difference between the total number of biscuits and the total number of butter cookies. Try finding those totals first, and then calculate the difference."", ""You've already identified the first error! You correctly realized you counted Javier's legs twice. Now, carefully re-examine your calculations to ensure you're not making any other similar mistakes. Pay close attention to which numbers you're adding and whether they represent unique individuals or if there's any overlap."", ""Winnie, you're so close! You correctly understood the meaning of double-counting after our conversation. However, look closely at the equation you set up: `x-3 = 26-16+8`.  The left side, `x-3`, represents the number of toddlers Bill saw. The right side `26-16+8` represents the number of toddlers Bill thinks he saw.  Think about what the problem is asking and consider whether the two sides of your equation accurately reflect the given information."", 'You included the border pieces (75) in your calculation of the total pieces placed by Trevor and Joe, but the border was already accounted for in the initial subtraction from the total puzzle pieces.']","[0.034482758620689655, 0.14545454545454545, 0.0, 0.16129032258064516, 0.0, 0.05555555555555555, 0.0, 0.0, 0.13513513513513514, 0.1515151515151515, 0.1509433962264151, 0.10526315789473682, 0.3137254901960784, 0.044444444444444446, 0.0, 0.1509433962264151, 0.21052631578947364, 0.0, 0.04878048780487805, 0.0821917808219178, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.03883495145631068, 0.03846153846153846, 0.04878048780487805, 0.0, 0.03174603174603175, 0.0, 0.0]",0.06493583159116136,0.07811185118413137,0.3137254901960784,12,"[0.3137254901960784, 0.21052631578947364, 0.16129032258064516]","[12, 16, 3]","[""You correctly calculated the number of pieces Joe placed and the total number of pieces placed by Joe and Trevor.
