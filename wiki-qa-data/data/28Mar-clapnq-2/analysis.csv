Based on the text we have, it seems like the inspiration behind the song\'s lyrics is a bit of a mystery, with two main possibilities:  1.  **Actual Birds:** Marley may have been inspired by actual birds (possibly canaries) that he saw near his home. 2.  **The I Threes:** Alternatively, it\'s suggested that the ""three little birds"" could be a reference to the three female singers from the reggae group I Threes, who often performed with Marley.  So, in essence, the song could be about:  *   The simple, uplifting presence of nature (the birds). *   A term of endearment for the I Threes singers, representing their importance to Marley\'s performances.  To dig a bit deeper, is there anything specific about the song that makes you curious? For example, are you interested in:  *   The overall message of the song? *   Why there are conflicting stories about its inspiration? *   How the ""three little birds"" metaphor might be interpreted?
