give three reasons why the fynbos biome is so important to south africa and the world	Of the world 's six floral kingdoms, Fynbos is the smallest and richest per unit of area. The diversity of fynbos plants is extremely high, with over 9000 species of plants occurring in the area, around 6200 of which are endemic, i.e. growing nowhere else in the world.

Of the Ericas, over 600 occur in the fynbos kingdom, while only two or three dozen have been described in the rest of the world.
