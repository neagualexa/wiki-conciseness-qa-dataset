At the time it was thought that all infectious agents could be retained by filters and grown on a nutrient medium -- this was part of the germ theory of disease .

He observed that the agent multiplied only in cells that were dividing , but as his experiments did not show that it was made of particles , he called it a contagium vivum fluidum ( soluble living germ ) and re-introduced the word virus . Beijerinck maintained that viruses were liquid in nature , a theory later discredited by Wendell Stanley , who proved they were particulate .

what kind of fish can you catch in the long island sound	The most common marine fish in the Sound include porgy, butterfish, winter flounder, summer flounder, windowpane flounder, fourspot flounder, northern and striped sea robin, little skate, menhaden, Atlantic silversides, black seabass, blackfish (tautog), cunner, bluefish, and smooth dogfish.  Frequently Atlantic bonito and false albacore, both members of the tuna family, enter the sound and can be caught by anglers from small boats and shore.  Anadromous fishes include striped bass, white perch, alewives, blueback herring, and American and hickory shad.  Although several shark species likely infrequently wander in and out of the Sound, e.g. blue shark, mako shark, hammerhead shark & thresher shark, there are only four species of sharks which are regularly found in the area.  These are the sand tiger shark, the sandbar shark, the spiny dogfish and the smooth dogfish.

why does context influence the way we understand text	In reading difficult handwriting context effects are used to determine what letters make up a word . This helps us analyze potentially ambiguous messages and decipher them correctly, and it can also affect our perception of unknown sounds based on the noise in the environment .

what is the process of somatic cell nuclear transfer	The process of somatic cell nuclear transplant involves two different cells. The first being a female gamete, known as the ovum (egg / oocyte). The second being a somatic cell, referring to the cells of the human body.  In human SCNT (Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer) experiments, these eggs are obtained through consenting donors, utilizing ovarian stimulation. The nucleus of the donor egg cell is removed and discarded, leaving it 'deprogrammed'. What is left is a somatic cell and an denucleated egg cell, these are then fused by inserting the somatic cell into the 'empty' ovum. The ovum, now containing the somatic cell's nucleus, is stimulated with a shock and will begin to divide. The egg is now viable and capable of producing an adult organism containing all the necessary genetic information from just one parent.

Somatic cell nuclear transfer involves fusing a somatic cell and a denucleated egg cell.
