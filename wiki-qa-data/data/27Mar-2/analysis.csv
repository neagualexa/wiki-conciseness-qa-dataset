He would have acknowledged her secular authority and social standing as a powerful noblewoman. He wouldn't have directly challenged her right to the title or her position.  *   **Expectation of Moral Conduct:** Grosseteste was a strong advocate for moral reform and believed that all members of society, regardless of their rank, were accountable to God. He would have expected Margaret de Quincy to live a virtuous life and to use her power to promote justice and righteousness within her lands. This expectation would have extended to her role in protecting the vulnerable and ensuring fair treatment for all.  *   **Potential for Conflict:** While he would have respected her position, Grosseteste was not afraid to confront powerful individuals, including nobles and even the King, if he believed they were acting unjustly or immorally. If Margaret de Quincy had engaged in behavior that Grosseteste considered sinful or detrimental to the well-being of her people, he would likely have intervened, either through private counsel or, if necessary, through public rebuke.  *   **Evidence is Limited:** It's important to note that specific details about Grosseteste's direct interactions with Margaret de Quincy are scarce. Historians would need to examine surviving letters, records of ecclesiastical proceedings, or other contemporary sources to gain a more precise understanding of their relationship. However, based on Grosseteste's known principles and his interactions with other nobles, we can infer the general nature of his view.  In summary, Grosseteste likely viewed Margaret de Quincy as a powerful figure whose authority he respected, but also as someone who had a moral obligation to use her position for the good of her people and in accordance with Christian principles."", ""Concerns arose regarding China's intentions after obtaining the T-10K (the prototype for the Su-33) from Ukraine because it provided them with a crucial technological stepping stone for developing their own carrier-based fighter aircraft. Here's a breakdown of the reasons:  *   **Reverse Engineering and Indigenous Development:** The T-10K allowed China to study the design, engineering, and technology of a high-performance carrier-based fighter. This significantly accelerated their own indigenous development program for such aircraft. Without it, they would have had to start from scratch, which would have taken much longer and been more challenging.  *   **Closing the Technological Gap:** At the time, China lacked experience in designing and building carrier-based aircraft. The Su-33 was a proven and capable platform. Acquiring the T-10K allowed them to close the technological gap with countries like Russia and the United States, which already possessed advanced carrier aviation capabilities.  *   **Military Modernization and Power Projection:** Developing a carrier-based fighter was a key component of China's broader military modernization efforts. It would significantly enhance their power projection capabilities, allowing them to operate aircraft carriers and project air power far beyond their shores. This raised concerns among neighboring countries and the United States about China's growing military influence in the region.  *   **Potential for Regional Instability:** The acquisition and subsequent development of carrier-based aircraft could potentially alter the balance of power in the region, leading to increased tensions and a greater risk of conflict.  *   **Intellectual Property Concerns:** There were also concerns about China potentially copying or reverse-engineering the Su-33's technology without proper authorization or licensing agreements.  In essence, the T-10K provided China with a shortcut to developing a critical military capability, raising concerns about their long-term strategic goals and the potential impact on regional and global security."", 'The Call-Up recorded their self-titled EP in **December 2006** at **The Farm** in Vancouver, BC. **Shawn Penner** helped them with the recording.', 'Maria Felicia Gunawan, a non-academic achiever from Sekolah Menengah Atas Kristen Penabur Gading Serpong, won a **gold medal at the International Exhibition for Young Inventors (IEYI) in 2015**.', 'Netscape Internet Service no longer exists.

The format was still popular, but facing challenges from television and changing reader habits. Here are some notable aspects of that period:  *   **Maintaining Popularity:** Syndicates and creators actively worked to keep their existing full-page strips fresh and engaging to compete with television. This involved evolving storylines, introducing new characters, and experimenting with art styles. Popular strips like *Peanuts*, *Blondie*, *Dennis the Menace*, *Beetle Bailey*, and *Li\'l Abner* were all thriving and innovating within the full-page format.  *   **New Strips in the Format:** While not a ""revival,"" new strips were still being launched in the full-page format, indicating its continued viability. Syndicates were still willing to invest in new talent and concepts for the Sunday comics.  *   **Artistic Experimentation:** Some artists pushed the boundaries of the format with more complex layouts, detailed artwork, and sophisticated storytelling. This was an attempt to offer something that couldn\'t be easily replicated by the simpler visual style of early television.  *   **Color Printing Advancements:** Improvements in color printing technology allowed for more vibrant and detailed Sunday comics, enhancing their visual appeal and helping them stand out.  In summary, the mid-1950s weren\'t about reviving a dying format, but rather about adapting and innovating within the existing full-page Sunday comic strip format to maintain its relevance in the face of new entertainment options.', ""One of the approximations used in deriving Kirchhoff's diffraction formula is that **the field and its normal derivative on the diffracting aperture are the same as they would be in the absence of the screen.**"", ""Researchers are likely trying to ascertain the relationship between religion and ancient politics in Wisconsin and the Cahokia area by investigating how religious beliefs, practices, and institutions may have influenced:  *   **Political structures and leadership:** Did religious figures hold political power?

Here are its key design and engine features:  **Design Features:**  *   **Parasol Wing:** This was a defining feature. The wing was mounted above the fuselage on struts, providing excellent visibility for both the instructor and student. This also simplified the wing structure and allowed for a relatively clean fuselage. *   **Open Cockpits:** Typically, the MS.315 had two open cockpits in tandem (one behind the other) for the instructor and student. This allowed for direct communication and a good sense of the aircraft's behavior. *   **Fixed Landing Gear:** The aircraft had a simple, fixed landing gear configuration, making it robust and easy to maintain. It usually consisted of two main wheels and a tail skid. *   **Fabric-Covered Structure:** The fuselage and wings were primarily constructed of wood and metal tubing, covered in fabric. This was a common construction method at the time, offering a good balance of strength and weight. *   **Simple Aerodynamics:** The MS.315 was designed for ease of handling and forgiving flight characteristics, making it ideal for novice pilots. Its aerodynamic design was relatively straightforward. *   **Robust Construction:** The aircraft was built to withstand the rigors of flight training, with a strong and durable airframe.  **Engine Features:**  *   **Salmson 9AB Radial Engine:** The most common engine used in the MS.315 was the Salmson 9AB. This was a 9-cylinder, air-cooled radial engine. *   **Power Output:** The Salmson 9AB typically produced around 80 horsepower. This was sufficient for the aircraft's training role, providing adequate performance for basic maneuvers and flight instruction. *   **Reliability:** The Salmson 9AB was known for its relative reliability, which was an important factor for a training aircraft. *   **Simple Design:** The radial engine design was relatively simple and easy to maintain, contributing to the aircraft's overall ease of operation.  In summary, the Morane-Saulnier MS.315 was a simple, robust, and reliable trainer aircraft characterized by its parasol wing, open cockpits, fixed landing gear, fabric-covered structure, and powered by a Salmson 9AB radial engine. Its design prioritized ease of handling and maintenance, making it a popular choice for flight schools in the 1930s."", 'After his initial work, Teun Voeten covered the following conflicts as a full-time war correspondent:  *   **Sierra Leone Civil War** *   **Liberian Civil War** *   **First and Second Congo Wars** *   **The conflict in Afghanistan** *   **The drug war in Mexico**  He worked for various publications, including:  *   **NRC Handelsblad (Netherlands)** *   **Vrij Nederland (Netherlands)** *   **Granta (UK)** *   **Vanity Fair (US)** *   **The Village Voice (US)** *   **Mother Jones (US)** *   **Newsweek (US)**', 'Robert Grosseteste held Margaret de Quincy, Countess of Lincoln, in high regard and saw her as a powerful and influential figure capable of promoting reform and good governance within her sphere of influence. He believed she had a responsibility to use her position and wealth to support the Church, care for the poor, and uphold justice.  Specifically, Grosseteste:  *   **Recognized her power and influence:** He understood that as Countess of Lincoln, Margaret held significant sway over her lands and people. *   **Encouraged her to be a virtuous ruler:** He urged her to be a model of Christian virtue, emphasizing the importance of piety, charity, and justice in her role as a leader. *   **Saw her as a potential patron of the Church:** He likely hoped she would support the Church financially and advocate for its interests. *   **Believed she could promote reform:** Grosseteste was a strong advocate for reform within the Church and society, and he likely saw Margaret as someone who could help implement these reforms in her own domain.  In essence, Grosseteste viewed Margaret de Quincy as a noblewoman with the potential to be a force for good, and he encouraged her to embrace her responsibilities and use her influence to promote Christian values and improve the lives of those under her care.', ""The acquisition of the Su-33 prototype (T-10K) from Ukraine by China raised several concerns, primarily related to:  *   **Reverse Engineering and Indigenous Development:** The biggest concern was that China would use the T-10K to reverse engineer the Su-33's technology and develop its own indigenous carrier-based fighter. This proved to be the case, as the T-10K significantly aided in the development of the J-15 Flying Shark.  *   **Circumventing Technology Transfer Restrictions:** By acquiring a prototype instead of a complete, operational aircraft, China could potentially circumvent international restrictions on the transfer of advanced military technology.  *   **Impact on Regional Power Balance:** The development of a carrier-based fighter capability based on the Su-33 design would significantly enhance China's naval power projection capabilities, potentially altering the regional balance of power in the Asia-Pacific region.  *   **Loss of Ukrainian Expertise:** There were also concerns about the potential loss of Ukrainian expertise in aircraft design and manufacturing, as Chinese engineers would likely seek to learn from and potentially recruit Ukrainian specialists involved in the Su-33 program.  In essence, the acquisition of the T-10K was seen as a shortcut for China to rapidly develop a carrier-based fighter capability, raising concerns about technology theft, regional security, and the potential for China to project power further afield."", 'The Call-Up recorded their self-titled EP in **2006** at **The Farm** in Vancouver, BC. **Shawn Penner** helped them with the recording.', ""While I don't have access to a specific database of individual student achievements at Sekolah Menengah Atas Kristen Penabur Gading Serpong, I can provide a hypothetical example based on the scenario you described:  **Hypothetical Example:**  Let's say a student named **Maria Susanto** at Sekolah Menengah Atas Kristen Penabur Gading Serpong is a highly dedicated and disciplined member of the school's Paskibra (flag-raising team). Through rigorous training and exceptional performance, she is selected to represent her school and province in the national Paskibra team. After further intensive training at the national level, Maria is chosen as one of the individuals responsible for carrying the Indonesian flag during the Independence Day ceremony at the National Palace. This is a significant honor and a testament to her dedication, discipline, and leadership skills, all developed and honed through her involvement in Paskibra.  **Why this is a good example:**  *   **Non-Academic:** Carrying the flag is a performance-based achievement, not directly related to academic coursework. *   **Realistic:** Paskibra is a common extracurricular activity in Indonesian schools, and selection for the national team is a prestigious accomplishment. *   **Specific:** It provides a concrete example of the type of achievement you were looking for. *   **Plausible:** It's entirely possible for a student from that school to achieve this, given the school's reputation and the student's dedication.  **Important Note:** This is a fictional example.

This means it requires a higher concentration of PEP to achieve the same level of binding and activity.  *   **Lower Activity at Physiological PEP Concentrations:** Because of its lower affinity, the dimeric form is much less active at physiological PEP concentrations. In other words, under normal cellular conditions where PEP levels are within a certain range, the dimeric M2-PK will not be as efficient at catalyzing the conversion of PEP to pyruvate as the tetrameric form would be. This leads to a bottleneck in glycolysis.  In summary, the dimeric form of M2-PK is characterized by a **lower affinity for PEP** and **reduced activity at physiological PEP concentrations** compared to the tetrameric form. This shift towards the dimeric form in cancer cells contributes to the Warburg effect, where glycolysis is favored even in the presence of oxygen.', 'Gregory Jim Rutherford Polanco is a Dominican professional baseball outfielder who last played for the Toronto Blue Jays organization.

This led to a reduction in size and complexity for many strips. Therefore, ""revival"" efforts were more about maintaining or enhancing the format against these pressures rather than a complete resurrection. Here are some notable aspects of that period:  *   **Efforts to Maintain Quality and Detail:** Some artists and writers actively resisted the trend towards smaller, simpler strips. They continued to produce visually rich and narratively complex full-page comics, even if it meant working harder or negotiating with syndicates. Examples include artists who maintained a high level of detail in their artwork, even as the size of the panels decreased.  *   **Experimentation with Format:** Some creators experimented with different layouts and panel arrangements within the full-page format to maximize visual impact and storytelling potential. This included using larger splash panels, innovative panel borders, and creative use of color.  *   **Popularity of Established Strips:** The continued popularity of established, well-loved strips helped to keep the full-page format alive. Strips like *Prince Valiant* by Hal Foster, *Flash Gordon* by Dan Barry, *Little Orphan Annie* by Harold Gray, and *Dick Tracy* by Chester Gould were still widely read and valued for their detailed artwork and engaging stories. Their success demonstrated that there was still an audience for high-quality, full-page comics.  *   **Color Printing Advancements:** Improvements in color printing technology allowed for more vibrant and detailed color reproduction in Sunday comics. This helped to enhance the visual appeal of full-page strips and make them more attractive to readers.  *   **Syndicate Support (to a degree):** While syndicates were often driven by cost-cutting measures, they also recognized the value of popular full-page strips in attracting readers to newspapers. Some syndicates continued to support artists who were committed to producing high-quality, full-page comics, even if it meant higher production costs.  It\'s important to note that there wasn\'t a single, organized ""revival"" movement. Instead, it was a combination of individual efforts by artists, writers, and syndicates to maintain the quality and appeal of full-page Sunday comics in the face of economic and technological challenges. The full-page format continued, albeit often in a reduced size, and these efforts helped ensure its survival.', ""Yes, it is accurate to assume that the field and its normal derivative are zero on the opaque parts of the screen when deriving Kirchhoff's diffraction formula. This is a crucial part of the Kirchhoff boundary conditions, which are used to approximate the field on the surface of the integration.  Here's why:  * **Kirchhoff Boundary Conditions:** The Kirchhoff diffraction formula relies on applying the Helmholtz-Kirchhoff integral theorem. This theorem requires knowing the values of the field (U) and its normal derivative (∂U/∂n) on a closed surface.  The standard approach is to choose a surface that includes the diffracting aperture and a large hemisphere at infinity.  The Kirchhoff boundary conditions are approximations for the values of U and ∂U/∂n on this surface.  * **Opaque Screen Assumption:** The key assumption for the opaque parts of the screen is that they completely block the light.  This means:     * **U = 0:** The field (U), representing the amplitude of the wave, is zero behind the opaque screen.  No light penetrates.     * **∂U/∂n = 0:** The normal derivative of the field is also zero. This implies that the field is not changing in the direction normal to the screen, which is consistent with the absence of light behind the screen.  * **Approximation:** It's important to remember that these are *approximations*. In reality, there might be some small amount of light that penetrates or diffracts around the edges of the opaque screen. However, for many practical situations, these effects are negligible, and the Kirchhoff boundary conditions provide a good approximation.  * **Justification:** The justification for using these approximations lies in the fact that the Kirchhoff diffraction formula provides results that are in good agreement with experimental observations, especially when the dimensions of the aperture are much larger than the wavelength of light.  In summary, setting the field and its normal derivative to zero on the opaque parts of the screen is a fundamental assumption in the derivation of the Kirchhoff diffraction formula. It's an approximation, but a useful one that allows us to calculate the diffracted field with reasonable accuracy in many situations."", 'Researchers at sites in Wisconsin and the Cahokia area are seeking to ascertain the relationship between the people of Cahokia and the Late Woodland peoples of the Upper Midwest, including Wisconsin.

Here's a breakdown of its key features and engine specifications:  **Key Features:**  *   **Configuration:** Low-wing monoplane. This gave it better stability and handling compared to biplane trainers of the time. *   **Construction:** Mixed construction. The fuselage was typically welded steel tube covered in fabric, while the wings were often wooden with fabric covering. *   **Open Cockpits:** Tandem open cockpits for instructor and student. This allowed for direct communication and observation. *   **Fixed Landing Gear:** Fixed, conventional landing gear (tailwheel configuration).

Here's a breakdown of what we can infer:  *   **Respect for her Status:** Grosseteste was a firm believer in the divinely ordained social order. He would have acknowledged and respected Margaret's position as Countess of Lincoln, a powerful and wealthy noblewoman. He understood the importance of the aristocracy in maintaining social stability.  *   **Concern for her Spiritual Welfare:** Grosseteste was a reformer and a pastor deeply concerned with the moral and spiritual health of his flock, regardless of their social status. He would have seen it as his duty to guide and correct even the Countess of Lincoln if he believed she was straying from the path of righteousness. This concern would have extended to how she used her wealth and power. He likely would have encouraged her to use her resources for charitable works, supporting the church, and ensuring justice within her lands.  *   **Potential for Conflict:** Grosseteste was known for his uncompromising stance against corruption and abuse of power, even within the Church itself. If Margaret de Quincy was perceived to be neglecting her duties, exploiting her tenants, or engaging in activities that Grosseteste considered sinful, he would not have hesitated to confront her. He was known for his strong letters of admonishment to people of all ranks.  *   **Evidence is Limited:** Direct evidence of Grosseteste's specific views on Margaret de Quincy is scarce. We don't have a surviving letter directly addressed to her, for example. Therefore, we must infer his views based on his general principles and his known interactions with other members of the nobility.  In conclusion, Grosseteste likely viewed Margaret de Quincy as a person of significant social standing whose spiritual well-being was his responsibility. He would have expected her to use her position and wealth responsibly and in accordance with Christian principles, and he would have been prepared to challenge her if he believed she was failing in this regard."", ""The acquisition of the Su-33 prototype (T-10K) from Ukraine prompted concerns regarding China's intentions because it provided them with a crucial technological stepping stone for developing their own carrier-based fighter aircraft. Specifically:  *   **Reverse Engineering and Indigenous Development:** The primary concern was that China would reverse engineer the Su-33 prototype to develop its own indigenous carrier-based fighter. This would significantly enhance their naval aviation capabilities and reduce their reliance on foreign suppliers.  *   **Advancement of Naval Power Projection:** A carrier-based fighter is a critical component of a modern aircraft carrier and a key element in projecting naval power. Acquiring the Su-33 prototype signaled China's ambition to develop a powerful blue-water navy capable of operating far from its shores.  *   **Potential for Regional Power Imbalance:** The development of a carrier-based fighter capability raised concerns about a potential shift in the regional balance of power in the Asia-Pacific region. It could allow China to exert greater influence over maritime disputes and project its military power more effectively.  *   **Technology Transfer Concerns:** There were also concerns that China might share or sell the technology derived from the Su-33 prototype to other countries, potentially contributing to the proliferation of advanced military technology.  In essence, the Su-33 prototype was seen as a shortcut for China to acquire advanced naval aviation technology, accelerating their military modernization and potentially altering the strategic landscape."", 'The Call-Up recorded their self-titled EP ""Undecided"" in **2005** at **The Blasting Room** in **Fort Collins, Colorado**.

Publishers were looking for ways to save money, and reducing the size of the comics section was one option. This led to a decline in the number of strips that could be printed in the full-page format.  Therefore, the ""revival"" wasn\'t about bringing back something completely gone, but rather about *maintaining* and, in some cases, *re-emphasizing* the impact and artistry of the full-page format against these economic pressures.  Here\'s what attempts were made and some notable examples:  **Attempts to Maintain/Revive the Full-Page Format:**  *   **Artist Advocacy:** Cartoonists themselves, often through their syndicates, pushed back against publishers\' attempts to shrink the comics pages. They argued that the full-page format allowed for more detailed artwork, more complex storytelling, and a greater overall impact on the reader. Some even threatened to leave newspapers that reduced the size of their strips. *   **Syndicate Promotion:** Syndicates like King Features, United Feature, and others actively promoted the value of their full-page strips to newspaper editors. They highlighted the popularity of these strips with readers and emphasized the advertising revenue they generated. *   **Experimentation with Layout and Design:** Some artists and syndicates experimented with different layouts and design elements to make the most of the full-page format. This included using larger panels, more dynamic compositions, and more elaborate color schemes. *   **Focus on High-Quality Art and Storytelling:** The best way to keep the full-page format alive was to create comics that were simply too good to cut down. Artists focused on delivering compelling stories, memorable characters, and visually stunning artwork that justified the larger format.  **Notable Examples of Comic Strips in the Mid-1950s that Exemplified the Full-Page Format:**  *   **Prince Valiant (Hal Foster):** A prime example of the full-page format being used to its full potential. Foster\'s detailed artwork, epic storytelling, and historical accuracy made *Prince Valiant* a visual masterpiece. Its full-page format was essential to showcasing the intricate details of the medieval world he created. *   **Flash Gordon (Dan Barry):** While *Flash Gordon* had various artists over the years, Dan Barry\'s run in the mid-1950s continued the tradition of visually stunning science fiction adventures that benefited greatly from the full-page format. *   **Rip Kirby (Alex Raymond, later John Prentice):** Raymond\'s sophisticated artwork and realistic storytelling made *Rip Kirby* a popular detective strip. The full-page format allowed for more detailed backgrounds and character interactions. *   **The Phantom (Lee Falk and various artists):** *The Phantom* continued its long run as a popular adventure strip, and the full-page format allowed for expansive jungle settings and exciting action sequences. *   **Little Orphan Annie (Harold Gray):** While the strip\'s politics were often controversial, *Little Orphan Annie* remained a popular strip, and the full-page format allowed for more detailed depictions of Annie\'s adventures. *   **Tarzan (Burne Hogarth):** Hogarth\'s dynamic and anatomically accurate artwork made *Tarzan* a visually stunning strip. The full-page format was essential to showcasing the power and grace of the character. *   **Bringing Up Father (George McManus):** A classic example of a gag-a-day strip that used the full-page format to its advantage. The elaborate backgrounds and detailed character designs added to the humor of the strip.  It\'s important to note that even these strips sometimes faced pressure to reduce their size, but their popularity and artistic merit helped them to maintain the full-page format for as long as possible. The struggle to preserve the full-page Sunday comic strip was an ongoing battle throughout the mid-20th century, and it ultimately led to the gradual decline of the format in favor of smaller, more economical sizes.', ""No, it is **not** accurate to assume that no approximations are made when deriving Kirchhoff's diffraction formula. In fact, the derivation relies on several key approximations, which limit its accuracy and applicability.  Here are some of the main approximations involved:  *   **Kirchhoff Boundary Conditions:** The most significant approximation lies in the assumption of the Kirchhoff boundary conditions. These conditions specify the values of the field (both the wave function and its normal derivative) on the diffracting screen. Specifically, they assume:     *   On the illuminated part of the screen aperture, the field and its derivative are the same as if the screen were not present.     *   On the opaque part of the screen, both the field and its derivative are zero.      These conditions are physically unrealistic, especially near the edge of the aperture. In reality, there will be some interaction between the incident wave and the screen material, leading to a more complex field distribution. The field doesn't abruptly drop to zero at the edge.  *   **Scalar Theory:** Kirchhoff's diffraction formula is a scalar theory, meaning it treats light as a scalar wave rather than a vector electromagnetic wave. This approximation is valid when the diffracting aperture is much larger than the wavelength of light. When the aperture size approaches the wavelength, the vector nature of light becomes important, and a more rigorous electromagnetic theory is required.  *   **Obliquity Factor:** The obliquity factor (often denoted as *K(θ)* or *cos θ*) arises from the application of Green's theorem. While it's a necessary part of the derivation, it's often simplified or approximated.  *   **Fraunhofer Approximation (Far-Field):** While not inherent to the Kirchhoff integral itself, the Fraunhofer approximation is often applied to simplify the integral for calculations in the far-field region (i.e., at a large distance from the aperture). This approximation assumes that the distance to the observation point is much larger than the size of the aperture.  In summary, Kirchhoff's diffraction formula is a valuable tool for understanding diffraction phenomena, but it's important to remember that it's based on several approximations. These approximations limit its accuracy, particularly when dealing with small apertures, near-field diffraction, or situations where the Kirchhoff boundary conditions are not well satisfied. More advanced techniques, such as rigorous electromagnetic solvers, are needed for more accurate results in these cases."", 'Researchers are seeking to ascertain the relationship of religion and ancient politics in a variety of places, including:  *   **Archaeological sites:** Excavations of temples, palaces, and other ancient structures can provide evidence of religious practices and their connection to political power. *   **Ancient texts:** Religious and political texts from ancient civilizations, such as the Bible, the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Code of Hammurabi, and the writings of ancient philosophers, offer insights into the beliefs and practices of the time and their relationship to political structures. *   **Museums and collections:** Artifacts and documents housed in museums and collections around the world can provide valuable information about ancient religions and politics. *   **Universities and research institutions:** Scholars at universities and research institutions conduct research on ancient religions and politics, using a variety of methods and sources. *   **Libraries and archives:** Libraries and archives hold a wealth of primary and secondary sources related to ancient religions and politics.
