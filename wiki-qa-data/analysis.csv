Therefore, his view of Margaret de Quincy's position as Countess of Lincoln would have been primarily concerned with how her actions and influence impacted the diocese and its holdings.  While I don't have specific documented statements from Grosseteste directly addressing Margaret de Quincy's *personal* worthiness as Countess, his general principles suggest he would have expected her to:  *   **Respect Church Lands and Rights:** He would have expected her to uphold the rights and properties of the Church within the Earldom of Lincoln. He would have been wary of any encroachment or attempts to diminish the Church's holdings. *   **Be a Just Ruler:** He would have hoped she would be a just and fair ruler, promoting peace and order within the Earldom, which would indirectly benefit the Church and its parishioners. *   **Support Religious Institutions:** He would have likely encouraged her to support religious institutions within the Earldom, such as monasteries and hospitals.  In short, Grosseteste's view of Margaret de Quincy's position would have been pragmatic and focused on how her actions as Countess affected the well-being and rights of the Church within her jurisdiction.

Here are its key design features:  *   **Wing Configuration:** The most distinctive feature was its **parasol wing**. This meant the wing was mounted above the fuselage on struts. This provided good visibility for the pilot and instructor, a crucial aspect for a trainer. The wing was typically of a wooden construction, fabric-covered.  *   **Landing Gear:** It had a **fixed, conventional landing gear** configuration. This meant it had two main wheels under the fuselage and a tail skid (later sometimes a tailwheel). The fixed landing gear was simple and robust, suitable for the rigors of training.  *   **Engine:** It was typically powered by a **Salmson 9AB radial engine**. This was a 9-cylinder, air-cooled engine that provided reliable power for training purposes. The engine was usually uncowled or had a partial cowling, leaving much of the engine exposed for cooling.', 'Robert Grosseteste held Margaret de Quincy, Countess of Lincoln, in high regard.
